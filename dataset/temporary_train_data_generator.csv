<sc> The front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph : ' A freed terrorist strikes again ' #TomorrowsPapersToday xxurl xxusr I  m just as afraid of Tommy Robinson supporters as I am ISIS terrorists . All extremists . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr Understandable considering the deluge of reports regarding Tommy Robinson supporters bombing pop concerts and attacking people with machetes . <- For those with a low IQ ! <er>
<sc> xxusr Thanks for the update but #cardsnation probably couldn  t care less about another one of these moves . xxusr I'll keep that in mind . But then when I don't point out a move I'll be reminded that I didn't point out that move . So awesome . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr Oh boy we just punched our ticket to the series . #MoSucks <er>
<sc> xxusr xxusr xxusr I always wonder why are minds always stuck in tier 1 production applications only ... there is a lot more out there ... imagine if we separated all batch jobs ( don  t tell me you don  t have any ) . Hence my # 1 advice to all cloud sales people was / is TALK WORKLOADS NOT APPLICATIONS ! xxusr xxusr xxusr From this side of the Atlantic at the launch of the largest industry event on the planet - #HM20 - Cloud   is dead  . Long live  Edge . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr xxusr Just like PC is dead ?  I love those industry pundits who kill tech waves with slides ! <er>

<sc> xxusr xxusr xxusr Oh suicides don't count ? I thought all you gun nuts were so concerned about mental health ? Hrm ... how do people get illegally owned firearms ? xxusr xxusr xxusr No of course suicide don't count . Somebody who wants to off himself can jump from the top of a freeway bridge . Are you going to pass a law against that ? How about freedom of choice I remember all leftist douchenozzles are all for that . Or is that only applying for baby killing ? <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr xxusr So because he can jump from the top of a freeway bridge we should make it easier for him . Makes perfect sense . <er>

<sc> xxusr xxusr And here was me thinking it was those extreme Christians again . xxusr xxusr xxusr There  s no link between the IRA and Christianity but you go ahead and generalise an entire terrorist group as Christians but we do the same with Islamic terrorists and suddenly we  re labelled Islamophobic / Xenophobic / Racist ? The double standard here is amazing please continue . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr xxusr I'm pointing out the double standard and you complain about the double standard . <er>
<sc> xxusr I'd love if Bernie Sanders became President but as with Jeremy Corbyn in the UK the establishment machine both democrat and republican will attack him in any way they can . xxurl xxusr xxusr Bernie is a significantly better candidate than Corbyn . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr xxusr Yeah well Bernie-hating opponents have accused him of being anti-semitic so he must be a racist <er>

<sc> Boy Scouts file for bankruptcy protection due to sex-abuse lawsuits xxurl xxusr Let us be honest here . It isn't just because of the sex abuse lawsuits .

<sc> Joining late ... IMO publishing blogging tweeting : its all about contributing to community conversations . If u have something valuable to say it will impact the conversation and people will value u for it regardless of citations or impact factors . #MedEdChat xxusr How can we get promotions committees to rethink some of this ? #mededchat <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr Yes of course you can .

<sc> xxusr It helps me to remember how much time in an institution is wasted . Then I feel less like I'm in over my head . Plus my husband and I are educators . So I'm getting giddy about running the show  xxusr xxusr I had to send the superintendent of whichever school district we were in at the time all sorts of paperwork including a record of hours spent in instruction . We had to do the same amount of time as a public school but every minute we spent was on instruction . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr Some parents get creative with the record sheet such as counting trips to the grocery store as instruction ( which it totally can be ) or taking a walk outside ( physical instruction ) . Don't forget recess . ( but not really ) Thankfully our state doesn't require it . <er>
<sc> United States seasonal flu fatality rates around 0.1 percent .

<sc> xxusr xxusr xxusr Some times I think they just do it for getting up there so much like Demand Expressions . Who could possibly argue that Picard is failing when we force the people who doesn't like it to talk about it . xxusr xxusr xxusr If that's the goal they are not very good in achieving it . We're talking more about Drekkie bigotry fake accounts and the idiocy if the actors than about STD or STP . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr xxusr Well they can always pay us for this proper and successful marketing work . <er>
<sc> Lol Stefan getting ratio'd by his fans on this one hahahaha xxurl xxusr It's a video of him explaining by eugenics is bad . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr Lookit all the knuckledraggers claiming they're superior <er>

If they  re really struggling to do 4K res no point to it now . <er>
<sc> UK Independence Day today . ( This flag flew at the Battle of Trafalgar . ) xxurl xxusr xxusr It has no relevance my family were at trafalgar something I  m proud off . Before you think I  m anti service men and women <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr You saw the flag and it triggered you . Why not say ' Ah a beautiful flag I descend from warriors who fought at the Battle of Trafalgar ' . No you are here start a Brexit debate which is now totally irrelevant . <er>

Who are they ? ? Mad stuff Alexander <ec> <sr> xxusr Farage is married to a German lady <er>
<sc> xxusr xxusr Nice to see you're reading your bible . The Hermeneutics is a wee bit dodgy . seems many of the " man " conversations in a way that seems foreign to me . The men with whom I speak don't seem to be represented among the man-side of your proposed conversations . Keep reading 2 kings ! xxusr xxusr xxusr This is the longest and most snobbish version of  Not all men  I  ve ever seen . <ec> <sr> xxusr xxusr xxusr No . All men . We are all horrible . Maybe y  all should just cleanse the earth of all males . The hermeneutical understanding is extraordinarily far off . And no most men are great . You  re just hanging out in a sewer waiting for a diamond ring to float by . xxurl <er>
