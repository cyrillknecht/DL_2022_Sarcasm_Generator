I will take shit that didn't happen for $ 100 No .. he actually in the gifted program and reads on second grade level . ... and he knows Kansas City is in Missouri and plays for the Jayhawks . #F---KINIA sporting a MAGA STAR cape and matching a T-Shirt with #Fireworks do you know how many #Fireworks were made in Canada ? about 15k each Year that the Incinerator started ... guess it started with a bang and the fans have been holding all the signs asking why can't we just have normal life ... and if we don't have a home we can't go to it / that we can't be a part of something amazing .That being said , the Incinerator doesn't have to be the biggest weird thing that's ever
Women generally hate this president . What's up with men ? I've hated him before he was placed in office , now I hate all his enablers as much as him , you woman will save this country and our world . Some of us men know that , are ok with that , admire that and will help with that .Dude , what are you talking about , myself ? This is the worst time to be a black woman in American history . I'm going to Hollywood and say it loud and clear : NO ! ! What ? Are you kidding ? You  re kidding about people that are white and male and not interested in having their identity called into question . #assimilation This is the result when we let our guard down and became good at it . I have never felt more vindictive , more defensive .I feel safe now that I have control of the education of my children  . Truly '  c the future my children will have no fear
When Spiked claim that Brexiteers knew exactly what they were voting for , it's quite obviously untrue in many cases . It's not snobbery - but let's be honest about the fact that , on both sides of t debate , there was a lot of ignorance . #thick Quite an articulate and considered comment but then finishes with ' that ' hashtag proving that he's still a #twat , racist , sexist , #phobic None of these comments are reflective of the views of the people on the left , nor of the movement as a whole .

Chinese Goverment is hiding the truth about #coronavirus deaths and confirmed cases are way more then they say .. If this true then its biggest theat to every human being on earth ... #coronavirus #wuhan Getting a bit hysterical . There is no way there could be that many confirmed cases . Not enough tests and medical personnel . And the number of people in crematoriums would be huge at any time in China and even higher with all the healthcare system disruption .Yeah , there  s no way China would lie . How fast are
Looks like Cherry for leader when Sturgeon goes in the Autumn I think it will be Cherry & I suspect a certain ex EU member now MP could raise his head . He has previous and I think he may well go for it soon . A shame the Conservatives have given in to pressure from the left . They keep delaying full Employment Insurance changes repeal until after the election . All while sexism and racism are still rife . #NeverNegative #GraceBlakeley We need to phase out carbon based fuels . Good time to start now . Sure , just turn the thermostat down 5 degrees , put on a couple more sweaters , Park the car & ride a bike , & while you  re at it throw out all your carbon based belongings .
