I will take shit that didn't happen for $ 100 No .. he actually in the gifted program and reads on second grade level . ... and he knows Kansas City is in Missouri and will tell you #StuHookley will teach him Goats . Bears . Angels . Dynamitrovic is a Canadian climber and the fourth Australian to win the Giro d'Italia . Ive always been a fan of his work . Good luck with your efforts to recoup lost wages .I'm not even sure if he's a bit sarcastic or just saying what he thinks ... but I can understand his frustration ...Ive never been one to sit idly by and do nothing You bet ! You keep claiming that 1.5 billion people voted illegally in #USA illegally voted for illegal aliens , but
Women generally hate this president . What's up with men ? I've hated him before he was placed in office , now I hate all his enablers as much as him , you woman will save this country and our world . Some of us men know that , are ok with that , admire that and will help with that . #hypocrisy " She went to the store and picked up a gun then the cop walked in . " That wasn't even close . That was the cop . I mean , the cop walked in and picked up a gun . The man who called himself Pete   said he  d been targeted by white supremacists , and that  s why he  s spent the last week questioning people who spread hate , questioning the patriotism of those calling themselves liberals , or whatever they  d called themselves .How dare you ! Stop . You are being violent here , I  m sure you can  t stop the hate . You obviously do
When Spiked claim that Brexiteers knew exactly what they were voting for , it's quite obviously untrue in many cases . It's not snobbery - but let's be honest about the fact that , on both sides of t debate , there was a lot of ignorance . #thick Quite an articulate and considered comment but then finishes with ' that ' hashtag proving that he's still a #twat #twit I personally support all of the EU's approaches and institutions to settle the so-called * vast * Dispute of the century . But I do so with great concern over the proposals contained in the * text * of EU law : EU law , in its current form , contains many legal loopholes and omissions that should be closed , replaced by fresh and vigorous debate on the constitutionality of the EU institutions and justice devolved institutions . As you know , this isn't even a Tory issue . It's a Labour one Did the #AlpinoDemonstrators actually start the #RioSROKE ? Because
I saw that - such care and consideration It really was . I'm packing it into my travel bag along with ' The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know Is Possible ' . Kindness such as that leaves an impression for ever & I will endeavour to pay it forward many times over . #MoreBeautifulWorldOurSylvesesKnowIsYepYeah I was at the Birmingham  E3 and had the chance to sit down with some of the people from E3 to talk about what it's been like to be in the mobile space and what  s been like . I spoke with a number of people who were there for very long time and it has been incredible to see the future of the company we started . The fans that supported us on so many levels has been absolutely unbelievable . They gave us an incredible platform to express themselves and create lasting change for the world . We are not going away , we are just
Looks like Cherry for leader when Sturgeon goes in the Autumn I think it will be Cherry & I suspect a certain ex EU member now MP could raise his head . He has previous and I think he may well go for it soon . A lot of people  hes talking about right now and the most recent comments from the Scottish Nationalist leader and his Scottish Nationalist colleagues about  not being united  and  not being Scottish  . I didn  t say  not being Scottish  is  not being Scottish        is being racist ?    No , I meant  being united  to which he responded   Not at all ! ! ! Americans   Don't  believe  the claims of the elites ... It  s actually the American people who are being lied to ... And yet , the media is treating this as an
Christ broke religious and cultural protocol to be Love . Take the courageous steps he took with the woman at the well . When history , tradition , upbringing and prejudice whisper , " Don't love them , " love anyway . Authentic followers of Christ love anyway and anyhow . Ok , you  re right , but how do you love someone who hates you , and wants you to not exist ? How do you love someone doesn  t share basic morals ? That's the bizarre logic of it all ! Did you know that Hillary Clinton has never won an election outside of the US ?  Sure did shock & saddened me . Our country has never been so lucky . It didn  t happen for the stupid reason that the tribes were not as mobile as they once were . It happened because the tribes believed in the system of government they had ruled for thousands of years . What was once a divided America has become the land of the free   And that  s all that I saw on the damn screen . I  m sure you can  t believe what I was told There is nothing inherently
The untold story is unfortunately blocked by juicy oil / gas contracts signed with illegitimate algeria military dictature to detriment of algerian ppl will . If there was no oil / gas in algeria , absurd #WesternSahara #territory issue wd have finished in 1991 . #SaharaOccidental You have said it ! Morocco is occupying western Sahara because of the oils . This was registered in the madrid accord when it took a lion's share of 65 % of the global market . All rights now , you got a signed document . My Little Pony : Stitch Pattern  My Little Pony : Stitch Pattern My Little Pony : Stitch Pattern Stitch pattern pattern , I know , I know . I just can't wait for the next season of #Hangover .Yup , we will have a season in which the Flash and Wonder Woman are the only women alive and the writers kept telling us that's not the case . Glad we  re moving forward ? Such a disappointing end to a fantastic season . What a sacrifice ! And you know it  s OK , because honestly , I
EMS faculty & staff - here is #EMSOzStudy Chapter 6 , Question # 3 . Q3 : Share an example of looking to do more . A3 : My students who willingly pick their classmates up who are struggling with a concept WITHOUT anyone having to ask for their help . #EMSOzStudy <- Responsive & open to constructive criticism of existing programs and practices <- to answer immediate and specific " What " about " What if " ? " What if it were your own fault ? What if it wasn't you ? What if it was us ? What if it was China ? What if it was you ? What if it was us ? What if it was us ? What if it was us ? What if it was us ? Ok , so the WWE paid them to do a live Q & A with them . They allegedly made fun of all WrestleMania titles and asked if you thought the company sweatshops Trish Stratus . I
Tuesdays can be a bit rubbish but I have driven to and from work with #HazellDean and #HeartFirst - the concept behind the art work is amazing and the #congas even get a mention in the sleeve notes . ( Once Again ) deserved to go I did my best ! I bought it on 7 " and 12 " , and played them until they nearly melted ! I'm commuting EVERYWHERE with the expanded Heart First this week , and having a wonderful time is one of my favorite things to do in town . Interesting you were to concede the point . I was wrong . The NFL is a corrupt system and the league and its owners are in no way involved . The league and union leadership is deeply involved . The league and union leadership is deeply involved in the negotiations . #FreeTheNFL Don't you dare say the union is the corrupt union . #fakenews Were you listening to the pundits or reading or listening to the radio ? I would have thought you were . I absolutely agree ! The pundits are the new MacGuffinheads This is a reflection of my own views
You're really straining your one working brain cell with that , aren't you ? Keep going , douche . Type that vile shit you wouldn  t dare say to my face , you garbage human being . Yes , I have a feeling it will be a while , but at least it's on your to-do list . #stopitcraft Yes , let's cut back on the hours and put in place a universal basic income . Sounds sensible .But universal basic income is not going to solve everything . It  s just not going to be enough , actually , says Mairead after some discussion , that's a priority for the future . So we're making it more difficult for people to get by . Are you saying we're not doing this enough ? Yes , because our economy is so strong and our middle class so thin
