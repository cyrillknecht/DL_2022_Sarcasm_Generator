Call it naive or what but I  m dumb enough to believe that I can work to making a better world then throwing my hands up and saying what a crap it  s become - ps please do not take this as an attack cuz it  s not im legit curious on how we parents should handle those moments Proper discipline for kids goes a long way towards teaching them how to behave as adults . Just being nice and tactful is something many seem to forget . Of course you also have to teach them that being nice does have its limits and when to take a stand . Again not accusing anyone but you can see it right my parents were of the generations that we will discipline and we will be friends after your an adult and moved out the house they weren  t supposed to be my friends growing up . I liked my friends but I didn  t respect them And I mean didn  t respect them by if they told me to clean my room or eat my food or be home by 10 I  d laugh at them . I appreciate the way I was raised - even more now then what I used to You do realize the meaning of discipline is to teach ? Right ? I agree to a point . Once your kids get to the point that you know nothing , sometimes the discipline is learn by experience . At least that's what we seen with our oldest . Its hard to have to watch it unfold . Know nothing ? Give and take Be that sound board new and different ideas on things . Yes some dont work . ( Experience ) But some R lets go with it .

But surely this is a bit over the top : \" The student who cuts and pastes an earlier work in a way that satisfies the demands of an assignment is acting no differently from one of Bloom  s anxious poets who succeeds in obliterating the memory of those from whom she plagiarised . \" I think your feudal state metaphor is exactly in reverse . The plagiarist is the Lord , the plagiarized the peasant . You work in the fields of prose , and some guy shows up and says  all this is mine .  That  s feudalism as it is . But the point is that entitlement and rent disappear . Then the situation you describe is impossible . The way nobody owns property laws of the Second Law of Thermodynamics . It's quite common in copyright questions to distinguish between ideas and works . So , for example , anyone can write a book about thermodynamics . But you can't use two pages from my book on the subject to cover the second law without asking \/ paying . Likewise , a student can't reuse the two pages they wrote on the second law for a short paper in the first term as part of a longer research paper at the end of the fourth . The law is still the same , the prose is just as true . But they must demonstrate they * still * understand it . I agree ; what  s more , what a small price to pay in many instances . Quotation and \/ or with citation . I must say that philosophers are very bad in paying that price especially if they should pay it to the unknown thinker . What they do is cite only those at the high places . Now , selective citing is proufoundly evil ."}

TX <URL> ----- Editing this comment since it seems to be at the top and this post is now front page of \/r\/all. This is in Fort Worth, Texas. The following post addresses Texas' relevant Move Over Law: <URL> which determines the legal requirements of vehicles coming upon an emergency stop. Basically, since not all of them could make it to the left lane, they are also legally allowed to slow 20 mph under the posted limit, which was 65 on this road. From the video and testimony from those on the ride, it's quite clear they were below that limit. The article states FWPD could not identify the officer. That is bullshit. I will not start a witchhunt, but he has been ID'd, namely by the people in the truck with the ticket, who were randomly hit with the pepper spray and have been pictured choking on it during the stop. Internal affairs is already on the task. Don't expect him to be fired right away. In fact, give the man a medal and a promotion like they already do everytime something like this happens. As you will likely find out, there were people in this large groups who did stunts. Some people are using that to justify indiscriminately ~~pepper~~ OC macing a large group of cyclist while they operate vehicles in heavy traffic in speeds in excess of 40mph. There are comments that pregnant women unassociated with the ride were hit by the spray. Ride safe. \"Does not know who the officer was.\" Car # 183, how the hell can't you pick that out of a roster. We know who the officer is. That's just posturing on their behalf. At the Toronto G20 summit, some cop randomly started wailing on some poor guy walking by and eight cops caught watching on video could not recall the incident or identify the cop. This is the world we live in, anyone can just have bad luck and get randomly attacked by a cop and if there isn't video, they will get away with it. The scariest part is that it seems like even if there is video, they still get away with it or let off easy half the time."}

It  s sad that people are celebrating this but I can  t help thinking that CR has been the author of her own downfall . It is sad . But Serena has been destroyed . Difficult to know how big a part CR has played in that but can't help but feel June 2018 would have been a far better time to leave with both Serena's and CR's dignity and popularity intact The irony is that when the storyline imploded earlier this year , JR had left & her popularity rocketed . CR stayed & her popularity & integrity vanished into thin air ? ?  It's sad that I don't feel sad about this . Serena's character was well and truly wrecked , and given by her shenanigans on Twitter , particularly the gaslighting of fans , I believe she had a hand in this . It backfired and I , for one , am happy to see her go . I suspect her twittering may hinder her career which is a shame but ... Well her agent or agents should be giving her guidance . Arguing and being snippy with the people who put you on the pedestal you decided to jump from . Not a good idea really We've all been led to believe that CR decision to leave Holby , a decision made months ago , was to head for pastures new ! Why continue to be snippy & antagonistic towards people , who in the great scheme of things , are totally irrelevant now ? Guess we hit a nerve somewhere ? I think she is genuinely hurt by how this has turned out . I think she felt they did the right by #berena . And we are wrong to be critical . She has left at a point when her character was at an all time low and I do think a glorious final year became let  s keep it simple . I agree . I think she had no idea that it would all go so horribly wrong . Perhaps they believed their own thoughts . I feel sorry for her as she was in too deep without support . But it demonstrates how wlw writers and advisors need to be involved and egos put aside The way #berena ended upset so many people and I'm sure it wasn't on her but she played a part . However , I do believe she was out on her own . The writers left her up the creek without a paddle . They avoided the social media torment , she could not . But I am glad she's going . I agree with everything said . I do feel sorry for her abit . After all she was one part of a fabulous bit of initial rep . I believe she was not ready for the adulation and the fallout . She seemed to completely unsupported when it went wrong and I think her leaving is related . I do think her behaviour on Twitter leaves a lot to be desired . She hasn't . helped herself at all ! I just feel sad about that . I  m blocked . No doubt about that . She has only devoted fans who really see her as infallible . That  s really sad . But equally I do understand that a highly critical and sometimes abusive onslaught can be debilitating . Agree the critical onslaught could have been unwelcome , so surely an explanation from someone , BBC \/ Holby , even CR herself could have prevented further distress . No 2 way dialogue has ever been forthcoming . We've just been ignored & blocked . Very mature way to behave . Yes it  s been a PR disaster and possibly a personal one too ."}

{"label":"SARCASM","text":"@USER Really , And what are you doing now ? If you don't like my reply then you should of thought about that before you replied to my tweet last night . Your debating skills amaze me .","context":"So I was reading this thread on the EI forum ( I  m not proud of myself I was bored ) . Anyway this so called punter \/ white knight \/ possibly another escort was pissed because this escort called Rafaella got a 4 star review . Not a bad review as 5 stars is the maximum number of stars that can be given . So he proceeded to slam the reviewer who is a good , honest reviewer a thing which is in short supply these days , especially on a site like Escort Ireland which is renowned for fake reviews . Anyway the usual suspect saps and irate escort alcoholic Nikita UK proceeded to attack this reviewer and other posters who spoke out in his defence . As the night went and started getting into the wee small hours ( well after 3am ) the posts from the white knights and Nikita started getting more abusive , irate and ludicrous . One post in particular by a poster called funboy 71 had me in snorting out loud with laughter at his logic for giving a bad review . Surely this sap cant be serious . According to him a bad review should only be allowed after visiting the escort more than once , ermmm no I don  t think so , a bad review can be left after the 1st visit . A bad review after the 3rd visit would have me thinking does this reviewer have a grudge , the 1st 2 reviews sung her praises , a 3rd review that  s bad would stink of revenge to me either because the client is pushy , abusive or stalkerish and the escort doesn  t want to see that client again . What followed was a honest review by a honest poster being deleted . Now what I do know is this , in the past this escort has been linked to several other escort profiles and allegations of sharing an apartment with up to 4 other escorts has been quickly shut down by the same irate mob <URL> Link to thread about the so called bad review , review which has now been removed <URL> <URL> The sap came forth and identified themselves . They blocked me after his or her tweet . Took their ball and went home . <URL> Well that  s your opinion and you are free to express it . I cant tell anyone what to do but I can make them aware of the facts which I have done in my pined post but lets recap . 1.Nikita UK is a self confessed alcoholic 2.Escort Ireland and <URL> know this Are you happy with this tweet ? I used to like you . You are acting like a wanker . Some of the best people in history had a drinking problem . So what ? I am not really fussed if you like me or not . Sure i follow you and you follow me but friendship has never came into it . I am simply telling the truth , now if you cant handle that un follow me . She has displayed abusive behaviour time and time again on both sites . To answer all your tweets & all your replies to me ; Dear Punter 08 , You're not fussed I hear you . But sometimes telling the truth whether it is your truth or not hurts people . If that was your agenda , success . If not think on ... attack everybody but escorts . I'm not attacking anyone and escorts aren't immune from criticism . You are coming across as a sap tbf . Not all escorts are bad , the ones i have mentioned are . Now if you have a problem with that thats fine , but i will not be a doormat for anyone . I'm probably a sap . But there are plenty of escorts that I had issues with but I don't post it all over social media . Just to be clear i deleted the original tweet from my news feed weeks ago about Nikita UK until Oskana , Oxi , Lexie Minx , Mia purple moderator for <URL> the so called american with the eastern European grammar brought it up again . So if she was going to tell lies about it i was going to post the truth and if that meant posting the screenshots to disprove her then that is her own fault not mine . And as far as hating someone which Nikita UK is now crying about i dont hate anyone especially someone i do not know . Thats just stupid and Nobody is discussing anything with you . You are just ranting ."}
{"label":"SARCASM","text":"@USER @USER You call this hieroglyphics ? Don't underestimate how varied language can be , this #4chan is probably far from what hieroglyphics really represented . Except the good of #kek I guess . #kekistanfinito <URL>","context":"It's not that the world is broken . It's that people are distracted from their lives by the images of their lives . Their parents were dream addicts too . We have made culture more important than biology , felling forests to build churches , turning teenagers into desk clerks . Why ? The answer is simple : we have confused the human desire for transcendence with money . The Protestant work ethic says that those who God has favoured will be materially successful . Financial enlightenment is billionaire status : transcendent level of the work ethic . It's a logical but unexamined conclusion : if god likes you a bit , you are rich . If he loves you a whole whole lot , you have billions . Transcendental wealth is the desire to experience god in money . No god yet ? Better try making some more money . Searching for infinity in coin . Making money as a spiritual practice is the unholy hybridisation of the Protestant Work Ethic and New Age movement . The search for enlightenment and the search for billions have unified in the western environment . But money is finite , and god is not . The money path never ends . We have to separate the urge to make money from the urge to know god . Money is finite and is used for finite , satisfiable goals in the material world . The impulse towards transcendence cannot be pointed at physical things without disastrous results . Light within . Work without . Consider this image . It exists to portray a certain kind of man at the peak of his aliveness . It is , in essence , a religious image . We all know this stuff . We know people paint the face of god on products to sell them . The question is , why does it work on us , even when we know ? <URL> The answer is that our brains are so primitive that we VERY SLIGHTLY think these images are real . We evolved in an environment without cameras and printers . Why would we have evolved defenses to being programmed by image to do what is bad for us ?

Make a list of the people who profit from it Wrong . Memes are a form of communication through symbols , just like hieroglyphs in ancient Egypt . Only those in the know can get the meaning .

{"label":"SARCASM","text":"@USER PS : I \u2019 m sure Israel and the US will be much more likely to cooperate with the Court now that the OTP has sought a jurisdictional ruling that will almost certainly go against Israel .","context":"1 ) W \/ benefit of time to digest , please find here my thread on #ICC #OTP jurisdictional request re #Palestine & Twitter response . Sorry , & less so ... some serious pushback on its way ! <URL> 2 ) Time to get on my hobby horse and say that the online responses to this filing again demonstrates how the #ICL court practitioner viewpoint is so underrepresented not only on Twitter , but the #ICL #ICC advocacy \/ policy \/ diplomatic \/ commentary community writ large . 3 ) For those who are #ICL litigators , the wisdom & ethnics of Fatou Bensouda's filing is manifest . While Patryk alluded to it , he gave it far too little weight . There may be a difference of opinion , but OTP's move was by far the wiser . 4 ) It would be ethnically & professionally reprehensible for OTP to go forward w \/ investigation , talk to witnesses & victims ( raise their exposure \/ protection issues ) , utilize staff time from not only OTP but other offices ( $ ) , spend large sums of money on the investigation itself , ... 5 ) ... have to manage expectations that will undoubtedly soar no matter what , and deal w \/ a myriad of challenging cooperation and related complications , all for the case to collapse years later on jurisdictional issues that could have been resolved years prior . 6 ) It is not hard to imagine the incredible backlash that would come in such a scenario ; a misstep that the #Israel \/ #Palestine issue \/ lobbies would use to eat the #ICC alive . The Court must act prudently , ethically , & professionally to navigate this terrain successfully . 7 ) To wait on this jurisdictional issue at a later juncture ( likely much later too ) has so many potential pitfalls , as described above , and would play right into the hands of realpolitik hardliners , or states wanting an \" out \" . 8) Need for significant pushback on Kevin's & Patryk's threads where they insinuate ( if not outright say ) that the jurisdictional issue is best determined at a later stage when the proverbial train has already left the station . I question whether these were serious points . 9 ) If we analyze this closely ( & open to me misinterpreting your comments ) , it is to say that an uber tricky legal & political issue should be decided by the fact that resources & time has already been spent , so no good reason to stop now . What ? ! ? 10 ) This issue should be decided by the letter of the law , not the expenditure of time , resources , and the like . If the Ct rejects jurisdiction & it is upheld on appeal , then so be it . We cannot manipulate ( diff from strategy ) the system to get the result we want \/ think it should be . Notice here how Kip describes complying with the Rome Statute as  manipulating the system .  As Patryk and I both pointed out , the Rome Statute does * not * require the OTP to adjudicate jurisdiction at this point . Major mischaracterization . Not saying  it  is a manipulation , but the reasons given for litigating later appear to be manipulation of the situation . Not mischaractizing anything . You said that ,  diff erent from strategy ,  waiting until later to litigate jurisdiction would  manipulate the system .  Show me where the law says the OTP has to do it now . Again , you conveniently leave out the reasons given to litigate later ( ie the train has left the station and that pressure will decide the matter ) . That is manipulating the system . I see . So complying with the rules in a manner that maximises your chances of success is  manipulating the system .  And I  m the one that doesn  t understand the practitioner  s perspective ! You have defined success here as only having one outcome . Maybe it could occur to you that the OTP is investigating the matter fairly and evenly , and don  t want to do so if outside the Court  s jurisdiction . Yes , I have defined success as a practitioner would  achieving one's litigation goal , which here is to investigate the Palestine situation . Your definition is fine if you  re working for an NGO , but lawyers want to win - - and ethical ones want to win within the rules . Again , define winning in terms of an INVESTIGATION , which this is . Yes , litigation of actual cases is where parties have clear goals of what is winning and losing . Not here . Further , you cannot be arguing that OTP defines winning as investigating in a situation where jurisdiction is lacking . So I am clear : I am not saying they don  t have jurisdiction . OTP effort is to better safe than sorry , a wise move when dealing w \/ Israel #Palestine issue"}

Malcom X didn't want cut ties to Africa \/ African he traveled to Africa and inspired many pan-africanist like Kwame nkrumah .

Specifically European and Arab . Truly ? When Zimbabwe became independent , the first thing Mugabe did is to order the killing of 20000 Ndebele people , who were loyal to his rival Joshua N'komo . Similar could be said to all other tribal wars , look at Rwanda genocide anf both Gongo wars . Black self-hatred ? Please . 1 ) Robert Mugabe was wrong when he killed ndebeles ( again black self hatred is a threat ) black people killing Africans is an act of black self hatred .

School calls parents, parents stand behind their sons choice. Mighty intelligent for a 10 year old. I hope the boy goes far. If you read the article, the boy was reprimanded for talking disrespectfully to his teacher, not for refusing to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. That's the catch-all crime: \"You're being disrespectful to MEEEEEEEEE! How DARE you, puny kid, defy what I -- the ultimate authority -- say?\". That's definitely the main crime in elementary school. And the kids really should listen to their teachers, the whole point of being in school is to listen to your teacher as she explains things to you. If the teacher has no control over the class, she can't teach. And yes, I used \"she\" instead of \"hehe\" for the abstract elementary school teacher, sue me. It shouldn't be a crime to tell a teacher that they are wrong. If you're right, the teacher and the class just learned something. If you're wrong, the teacher can better explain why you're wrong, and you've just learned something. When teachers bring politics into the classroom, that's the right time to tell them they are wrong. I once had a teacher get mad at me because I told her that Texas was, in fact, not the largest U.S. State, despite her smugly holding up a U.S. map that showed Alaska to be clearly smaller. I was in kindergarten. I had a teacher get mad because I pointed out that claiming \"people concede the existence of Jesus every time they use the gregorian calendar\" makes no logical sense.

PLEASE SPREAD THIS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. There's actually a way to force the Senate to vote on saving net neutrality. It's called the Congressional Review Act. Under this law, Congress can block any agency decision by passing a resolution of disapproval in both chambers. This resolution cannot be filibustered in the Senate and only 30 senators need to sign a petition to force a vote. Ed Markey has already said he'll introduce a CRA resolution: URL Susan Collins supports net neutrality. If Doug Jones wins tomorrow, that would mean only one other Republican senator would need to flip for the bill to pass the Senate. S if you live in Alabama and care about net neutrality, you should definitely vote. Edit: To clarify though, trump could still veto the resolution and it would also have to pass the House. But this is a way to force every senator to take a position on this issue before next year's midterm elections. And who knows what will happen if it builds enough momentum. Elected politicians are a lot more responsive to public opinion than FCC commissioners are. The CRA was actually passed by Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in the 1990s to make it easier to kill regulations. But it applies as much to an agency decision to repeal a regulation as it does to enact one. It sure would be deliciously ironic to use the CRA to save net neutrality. If you're curious about the CRA, you can read more here: URL Start pleading with the ones whose only got $15 bucks from the isp lobbyists . If we start a go fund me we could buy their votes and actually participate in the US political system for once. > If we start a go fund me we could buy their votes and actually participate in the US political system I have no idea what's involved in hiring a lobbyist, but the idea of crowd sourcing them is pretty interesting.

Operating in a sea of commercial press and broadcasters which are almost exclusively right or centre , BBC  s self-proclaimed  impartiality  is the bulwark . 3 The bulwark failed . BBC become just another right-wing voice , pumping out the same hate and bigotry as every other right-wing news outlet . 4 BBC failed the UK .

I would love to see the videos released in their entirety . Why , then , are the Pentagoons denying the veracity of the video ? Or walking it back , or whatever they're doing ? Blow-back ? If they released it as message to Russians \/ Chinese , perhaps unintended consequence of ppl now believing aliens exist is blow-back they're now reeling in . Maybe the best cover story for any top secret research was in 1947 in Roswell NM . What if the truth was told then but no one has accepted it . Operation Mogul . The story died away until 1980 . Roswell is a hoax - there never was a UFO crash there . The UFO industry around Roswell is an actively promoted psy-op to corral the herd into a fantasy safe-space away from the real events , which are nowhere near Roswell . This farce soaks-up time to prevent facts being discovered . I know . But the term flying saucer had just hit the public imagination in June 1947 . Now 72 years later there has never been another crash . So if the start of all of this is a lie still being perpetrated what does that say ? If a crash happened in China , why would China tell the world ? Therefore , a crash in china would remain secret . Thus , to say ' there has never been another crash ' is not a statement we have any evidence for , knowing that crashes would be classified . Why , then , was Roswell leaked ? Too many witness to deny something happened . That  s the problem with crashes witnesses No one saw jack at Roswell . I'll leap into a volcano like Empedocles if there is a scintilla of truth to Roswell . I have my own ideas about what they are and what they are doing"}

You would probably see a push for a national sales tax to offset it, which is, by definition, an extremely regressive tax that would disproportionately impact poor and middle-class people. The decrease in revenue would be an excuse for a gutting of social services and federal programs of all kinds, although probably not the military.

We just don't want our kids to have ready access to it on their personal devices , let alone content pushed to them without even looking for it . And just like you lock your guns up , you lock their access to porn . It  s on the parents , not the government . It's so weird to see so many right wingers now calling for more government control when not to long ago they wanted to make government smaller . We have govt control around anything extremely immoral . Murder for example . Plenty of right-wingers supporting that . And ? Are you trying to say porn is like murder ? Nope - but you insinuating I might be is fairly disingenuous . Let's just chat , that shouldn't be too hard . Govt regulates things that are extremely harmful to society . Porn is exactly that . You want to hurt yourself ? Fine . But let's stop making it readily accessible to minors . It has nothing to do with the discussion which is why I asked . You havent proven porn is harmful once . You keep throwing out that claim acting like it's TRUE . And even worse , now claim i am harming myself somehow and acting like porn is available to minors when it's for 18 plus So please dont tell me what is and isnt disingenuous when you've done all those things in your tweet . If you want to believe porn is harmful . Fine , that's your opinion . But stop stating it like it's a fact when you've yet to back that claim up . It has everything to do with the discussion . Govt regulates harmful ( incl . immoral ) things , esp . for minors . Not a controversial claim , but it obv . made you feel defensive - and in turn flippant : \" ArE yOu TrYiNg To SaY iT's LiKe MuRdEr ? ? \" 1 \/ You don't agree it's harmful ? That's fine , you can simply say as much without getting angry : \" I disagree about the useful affects . Many studies show the exact opposite . \" See ? That's not so hard - for someone who's being honest . 2 \/ At any rate , us \" right-wingers \" believe it IS harmful - mostly to the spirit . Which is why scientific studies are so mixed - they can't quantify it exactly . 3 \/ But SUPPOSE we're right , just for second . Then it would make sense for govt to regulate it like other serious things . Maybe with an outright ban , like murder ; or maybe with regulation , like alcohol . Maybe it's ok for adults , but we need to keep it away from minors . 4 \/ Point is , t's not a \" weird \" position to have - we simply disagree . If it triggers you so badly to have someone disagree with you , then further discussion is pointless . I'm going to enjoy my Sunday ; but feel free to shout your anger into the wind . \/ End"}

{"label":"SARCASM","text":"@USER @USER I'm sure your choice to post a gif from the movie that defines your life had nothing to do with your INABILITY to explain how a single failure in a system is justification for discarding the whole system .","context":"While I'm glad a good guy with a gun stopped him from slaughtering that congregation , two men whose lives mattered were slaughtered because the bad guy had a gun to begin with . Guns are a problem . Two points : 1 ) You can't eliminate guns . 2 ) The killer can kill without a gun ( Arson , vehicular homicide , and many more ways to do so ) , but it's a lot harder to stop them without one . Right . And men with guns stopped him . If you take away all the guns from the scenario , he could use another weapon to kill people , but the people would have no effective means to fight back . So a knife has a faster kill rate than an AR or shotgun ? I'd rather take my chances against the knife . This old trope of an argument is spoon fed NRA garbage . No , but a vehicle does . And what's the best way to stop a madman with a vehicle ? That's right , a gun . What you're saying is that you'd rather be disarmed completely , and hope killers use ineffective ways to kill people , than have the opportunity to defend yourself effectively . I'm saying that the argument of gun control leaves guns with criminals , or they will kill somehow anyway so may as well be a gun , are tired overused propaganda from the NRA . No one is going to take all the guns . Believing they'll try is idiotic . Common sense control is a must . But every proposal affects only the law-abiding , and does next to nothing to stop criminals . Universal background checks ? Long waiting periods ? Criminals can still steal guns or buy them on the black market . \" Assault weapon \" bans ? Ineffective at saving lives . What's your idea ? And what we're doing now is saving lives and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals ? ? Yes , violent crime is trending downwards . But I agree that more should be done to stop dangerous people . Widespread education on safe storage of firearms and the importance of theft prevention would be helpful . But people don't want gun education in schools . We could allow the general public to access the NICS background check system so they can verify who they're selling a gun to without paying a gun dealer to run the check for them . But nobody has proposed that . It depends on the dealer . Around me , it's usually around $ 25-30 . Add in the time and hassle of butter and seller finding a gun store that's open at a time convenient to both , and an unfortunate number of people might just say \" Eh , I'm sure you're fine \" and selling the gun . Then it would be an illegal sale if 100 % background checks become law . It's an illegal sale anyways , because it's illegal for a criminal to buy guns . That's why they steal them ( which is illegal ) , or use straw purchasers ( which is also illegal ) . You could pass 100 % background check laws , but it will only affect people who obey the law anyway . It would flag people with mental health issues , domestic violence arrests , etc . <URL> It could , but it could fail , too . Especially when people just don't obey the law . That's why I prefer giving people other than gun dealers access to NICS checks . It's not a burden on the law-abiding , but it will give them the ability to avoid selling to anyone who is prohibited . The Aurora , Illinois shooter was a prohibited possessor , yet he was abled to buy a gun at a store because NICS failed . Also , the vast majority of criminals obtained their guns through theft or the black market . Last night my wife's car failed to start and she called be for help . I told her that if it failed once , then it's useless . Don't try and fix it . Don't even buy another one , because if one car fails then all cars are worthless , or at least I WOULD HAVE said that if I were INSANE ."}

He testified that he couldn't produce proof of the attack, because it would damage the security of their servers if he showed any server logs (bullshit).

DaGreatOne 8 What was wrong ? Are you saying Ty offered to have Vic pay the defense fees ? Because that is what you are insinuating if you say I am wrong . That would make him more incompetent than I thought , which isn't really possible . DaGreatOne 8 And yet monica's motion to dismiss the appeal that was filed by ty beard was denied which means the appeals are going through , nice try DaGreatOne 8 The motion to dismiss was only because it was filed too early . He could have refiled even had it been dismissed , so the appeal was expected . No \" gotcha \" moment there , try again . Though , with the intelligence you are showing , don't expect to get one . DaGreatOne 8 Lol your attempts at damage control is pathetic . Cry harder . DaGreatOne 8 He  s literally just explaining reality , my dude . You can go fact check him . Ask where to look if you don  t know . DaGreatOne 8 Reality is that there is no evidence against vic , no police reports and if it's true and they knew about it why didn't anyone go to the police ? ! Why didn't they do anything about it ? ! Why didn't they stop him ? ! Why did they allow it to continue for an entire decade ? ! ! ! DaGreatOne 8 There is evidence , that is what the depositions are . Evidence . And since no one is being charged with perjury , the court feels they are true . Including Vic , who gave damnable testimony against himself . DaGreatOne 8 So why did lemon try to depose Chris slatosch then ? DaGreatOne 8 I knew some speculation about that at some point , but no longer recall what it was they were going to ask him about . So I can't answer that off the top of my head . DaGreatOne 8 So you don't know why and you're just grasping at straws then ? DaGreatOne 8 Um , no , I have multiple other points that back me up . Read my previous comment in the thread , for example . I know you struggle to keep up with conversations , but do better . DaGreatOne 8 You people seem to forget that the case is a \" civil case \" and not a criminal one , so the accusations are just \" assumed \" true ... there's no evidence to back up the affidavits . DaGreatOne 8 No . None of that is correct . Do you want the real answer ? DaGreatOne 8 Rabbit , I was talking about this bit :  so the accusations are just \" assumed \" true ... there's no evidence to back up the affidavits .  We don  t have private prosecution here in the US . DaGreatOne 8 Ok , prove that the accusations are true , and that the women are totally traumatized by the events DaGreatOne 8 The accusations are true because the court believes the depositions and did not charge anyone with perjury . They are also true because Vic admitted to them . Prove they are not . DaGreatOne 8 Oh yes look how traumatized monica looks when she had dinner with him last year and the emoji she used totally shows that she's traumatized when around vic  <URL>"}

This isn't actually that strange, and is normal for a lot of Japanese companies. CEO's in Japan make significantly less than their American counterparts. American CEO salaries are usually 300x that of the average worker in the company. Japanese CEO salaries are closer to 15x. That info might be out of date now, last I checked Western influence was creeping in, but fundamentally Japan is still a collectivist culture regardless of Western meddling. It would be seen as shameful to take a large pay increase at the cost of the worker's overall success. Heck, I remember watching a documentary back in the 90s about Japanese companies and one of the CEOs was asked what advice he would give to American CEOs, and the first thing he said is that American salaries are far too high. Lol yeah, that's some advice that American CEOs are definitely going to take: \"lower your own salary.\" deleted Sounds quite likely tbh, most CEOs are meant to be ambitious people but there's a very thin line between ambitious and greedy"}

{"label":"SARCASM","text":"@USER @USER Ohh , so close , but the correct answer was , \" What is . \"","context":"I'm saying that the argument of gun control leaves guns with criminals , or they will kill somehow anyway so may as well be a gun , are tired overused propaganda from the NRA . No one is going to take all the guns . Believing they'll try is idiotic . Common sense control is a must . But every proposal affects only the law-abiding , and does next to nothing to stop criminals . Universal background checks ? Long waiting periods ? Criminals can still steal guns or buy them on the black market . \" Assault weapon \" bans ? Ineffective at saving lives . What's your idea ? And what we're doing now is saving lives and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals ? ? Yes , violent crime is trending downwards . But I agree that more should be done to stop dangerous people . Widespread education on safe storage of firearms and the importance of theft prevention would be helpful . But people don't want gun education in schools . We could allow the general public to access the NICS background check system so they can verify who they're selling a gun to without paying a gun dealer to run the check for them . But nobody has proposed that . It depends on the dealer . Around me , it's usually around $ 25-30 . Add in the time and hassle of butter and seller finding a gun store that's open at a time convenient to both , and an unfortunate number of people might just say \" Eh , I'm sure you're fine \" and selling the gun . Then it would be an illegal sale if 100 % background checks become law . It's an illegal sale anyways , because it's illegal for a criminal to buy guns . That's why they steal them ( which is illegal ) , or use straw purchasers ( which is also illegal ) . You could pass 100 % background check laws , but it will only affect people who obey the law anyway . It would flag people with mental health issues , domestic violence arrests , etc . <URL> It could , but it could fail , too . Especially when people just don't obey the law . That's why I prefer giving people other than gun dealers access to NICS checks . It's not a burden on the law-abiding , but it will give them the ability to avoid selling to anyone who is prohibited . The Aurora , Illinois shooter was a prohibited possessor , yet he was abled to buy a gun at a store because NICS failed . Also , the vast majority of criminals obtained their guns through theft or the black market . Last night my wife's car failed to start and she called be for help . I told her that if it failed once , then it's useless . Don't try and fix it . Don't even buy another one , because if one car fails then all cars are worthless , or at least I WOULD HAVE said that if I were INSANE . I'm sure your choice to post a gif from the movie that defines your life had nothing to do with your INABILITY to explain how a single failure in a system is justification for discarding the whole system . Cars fail regularly as well . In fact AAA responded to 32 million calls for service in 2015 , and that's just ONE of the nation's roadside assistance providers . But you keep shining a light on your failure to provide an intelligent reason to discard rather than repair w \/ those gifs Maybe because I never said to discard it     I merely showed that it fails . Maybe comparing a constitutionally protected right with cars is not the best comparison     <URL> Oh , that's my bad .

His ruling will make much more sense after you read it: <URL> **Sherill TLDR**: In order to revoke a pass, The White House must follow the process requirements set forth in the Sherill case\/Administrative Procedure Act **(written notice, opportunity for hearing over the matter)** The White House likely didnt follow the process and thats in part why the judge ruled the way he did.

Im not a lawyer and I only know this because I was literally in the courtroom on Wednesday to listen to the arguments. Shoutout to my new buddy R, who I met at the courthouse and who helped me understand a lot of this. P.P.S: There are actually two matters at hand here. First, the legality of the process by which Acostas hard pass was revoked.

As for Kemar , he had the option not to sign the 2018 contract . 1 ) oldest rostered player currently is 29 . 2 ) Kemar got raise before Long & Parker got PAID .

Kemar can ask for more money , but to go after the club plans a year after he got a raise is bs . And to call the club unambitious when the players covering his back were renewed is just a lie . Ambition is subjective . Look at the players brought in over the past 12 months . what was the need for  big  signings after 18 ?

Read the transcript . The call was perfect , as the president said . There  s no crime by Trump , but there certainly seems to be a few by Biden . What Transcript ? The actual call transcript was quickly moved to a top secret server and we have not seen it ! What Trump released was amemeo written by his lawyers ! Even hostile witnesses , such as Vindman and Hill , testified that what President Trump released is accurate .  Very accurate ,  Vindman said . So then why hide the real transcript and release an atty written memo ? All Trump needs to do is release the actual verbatim transcript and this can all end . Trump will not do that and its obvious why ! Well it seems like you have all the answers ! Case closed !      LOL , And you seem to want to avoid a discussion about why the real transcript was not released !"}

Even though there are tons of people using the hastag #trapcosplay and not in a demeaning way . They are using it about themselves .","context":"Racism is such a nasty infection , and unfortunately , it's found on both sides of the aisle , even by those who think they are calling it out . We shouldn't turn a blind eye , but at the same time , we should be careful in what we call racist . #racism #racist I've been called #racist because of something seemingly innocent I've said , but because I'm white I'm judged for saying those things . Or a look I give someone . But if I direct that expression to a white person , I'm no longer racist . I think I see a double standard . #racism There was an incident in high school with a foreign exchange student from Germany ( if memory serves ) . I don't remember exactly what I said , but it wasn't something to the effect of ... \" Did you write it down ? \" I gestured like I was holding a pen writing something . That is ridiculous . I'm white and not racist . And I happen to be related to some Olympic-level racists . Unless that is just considered a rude gesture in another country I don't get it . If it was considered racist or offensive , ignorance of that fact does not equal racist . Racism is the thought that one race is better than another based on the virtue of them being different . Behaving in a racist way includes : telling racist jokes , using slurs in a derogatory way , treating somebody of a race poorly or differently only because of their race . There's nothing wrong with that definition except in how's it applied . If I'm standing in a group of black guys . One tells a racist joke about black people . Everyone laughs , including me . They aren't racist , but I am . That's the double standard . Perhaps I didn't find it funny ... Right , the double standard is always a fun one to talk around . That's part of how intent defines it . They were arguably in that situation laughing at the stereotype not the content of the joke in a belittling way . Granted , I've never been called racist at all ... Recently I saw a writer called out for describign a POC character's eyes as exotic . Definition : originating in or characteristic of a distant foreign country . That word alone is now considered racist . But only if the writer is white , AKA preestablished intent . See , I'd never see that as racist . If the writer in their narration passage called a POC character a slur , Idc what color the writer is , that to me is racist . Using \" exotic \" as in \" not of my homeland \" seems like just following the dictionary definition . As I mentioned in the rest of my thread , a slur can also be unintentional . A writer may do their research , but they can't help the reactions of trigger happy people who like to call everything racist . It's often the color of the writer who is mostly on trial , not the words . The word spelled : T-R-A-P is considered a cosplaying slur . I learned because of an angry outburst screaming over me & not hearing me ask what the PC term is . I meant to refer to a character type . Not to demean people . Words identify things . I still don't know the PC word ."}

Back in high school during the final year, some teachers would let us chill during some of the classes. We'd be done after like 30 minutes and then we could do whatever we wanted as long as we weren't loud or inappropriate. I'd frequently listen to songs I found through osu! with my headphones on and finger tap the table to mimic the rhythm. This one time I thought I was doing nothing out of the ordinary when suddenly someone from behind put their hand on my shoulder. I took my headphones off, turned around (I was in 1st row) and a few people (teacher included) were looking at me. The guy who tapped my shoulder then said \"you're being too loud on that table\". I wasn't thinking about it back then, but now I wonder if I was tapping with my nails or if I was going rafis mode on a wooden table.

With the front-month as your  signal ,  you expect the back-month to decay  and to collect the difference . Is this , per se , an  edge ?  <URL> i'm sort of confused about the question . when you say expect the back month to decay , do you mean expect the implied volatility of the long dates to fall ? if so , why ? the long term equilibrium state of vol term structures is upward sloping because of term risk premium any vanilla option position has some theta ( time decay ) , gamma ( exposure to realized volatility ) , vega ( implied volatility exposure ) , and volatility rolldown ( from the shape of the vol term structure ) . > > A short dated option has a lot of theta and gamma , and relatively little vega . A long dated option has almost no gamma and theta but has a ton of vega . Almost all the risk of a long dated option position is to vega . > > That risk is inversely correlated with the market , so there is a risk premium associated with it , manifested in an upward sloping volatility term structure in normal markets . You don't ' collect more VRP ' being short a 2 year option at 15 vol vs a 3 - month option at 13 vol . The theta you collect is much , much lower , and typically so is the vol rolldown per unit of time . I would hate trying to close a 2 year option when the SHTF these days ."}

Blech 2\/2 <URL>","context":"Here are my top 10 stories from last year . I  m amazed at all God revealed and accomplished through this blog . And I  m grateful for every source who entrusted his or her story and information to me . This was a team effort ! <URL> I still don  t get this . HBF was a subsidiary how ? According to who ? It had a diff board , no ? Also , why didn  t anyone fight HBC 1 on HBF donors behalf ? Instead Wisen , , et al took the pseudo-spiritual high road of silence on theft of donor funds  <URL> The HBF board was there only in theory , according to my sources . HBF was under the HBC elders who had no idea what was going on . I  m not trying to be difficult , but what does  under the HBC board mean  ? Are the sources saying that HBC 1  s board was secretly the boss of HBF ? The sources  use of  subsidiary  makes it sound like there was some kind of actual legal position of authority of one over the other It wasn't secret . According to former HBF director , Gordon Zwirkoski , James very clearly articulated that he wanted HBF brought under HBC & the HBC elders . HBF allegedly ceased to be a separate 501c3 and became an auxiliary of HBC . At least , that's the narrative . When does Mr Zwirkoski allege that happened ? What year ? Unless he says 2017 , financial statements , the IL SoS , and the IRS conflict w \/ his narrative , as far as I can tell . With these various \" open \" EINs , I have big concerns about theft & money laundering He can  t attest to it happening . In fact , he opposed it and that  s why James fired him . No one seems to know for sure . My guess is only Fred Adams and James know  and maybe Steve Huston . And maybe they kept separate orgs for the purpose you suggest . knew . Seems pretty clear here . Also , HBF was renamed Vertical Church Network in Feb 2018 , per IL SoS , and uses the same EIN as HBF , it appears . <URL> Yes , but the confusion was how it  s a 501c3 but not a separate legal entity from HBC . Can  t remember the term . Auxiliary something . Integrated auxiliary . My current understanding is that if it were an integrated auxiliary , would have \/ should have noted it here . I can ask a NFP accounting expert . Probe your NFP expert . I confess this is a new term for me . See here <URL> Also , here's a screenshot from the final HBF audited statements by I see no lack of clarity here about what HBF was as a legal entity . If it was an IG of HBC , then why didn't CC say so ? <URL> Moreover , HBF transitioned into VCN ( same EIN and IL corp file number ) . No one is asking if VCN is an integrated auxiliary of HBC , and no action was taken for it not to be . Why ? Because HBF wasn't a IA , in my opinion If it wasn  t an integrated auxiliary as Harvest leaders claimed , then HBC stole from HBF . If it is an IA , then what happened cannot be stealing because HBC & HBF we  re legally the same . Right . More importantly , it means HBC stole from HBF donors . Has any HBC leader , current or former , ever told a straight , complete story when it comes to money or real estate ? Even the folks who aren  t  lying  don  t ever seem to have the full story . When it comes to HBF , Harvest withheld info from those conducting the financial review . Even Wisen didn  t know for sure whether HBF was an integrated auxiliary or not . I couldn  t get a straight answer from Harvest about the board . Just a hot mess . GCC should ask for $ HBC owes . I replied here . Seems to me that the entity relationships are made crystal-clear . I  m also not seeing that HBC owes GCC anything . HBC owes donors to HBF , which may include $ given to HBF by the church plants . <URL> <URL> Almost all of HBF's budget was from the independent Harvest churches that comprised HBF . When James disbanded HBF , those churches formed GCC . So I think GCC has a right to the $ . Or , the approx 150 churches could seek reimbursement individually , but that would be vry complicated GCC as an entity wouldn  t have a right to that money , in my non-lawyerly opinion , b \/ c GCC didn  t give the money & was formed ex post facto If the stolen money was directly from churches giving the 5 % franchise fee to HBF , then the churches could perhaps band together & sue 1 \/"}

Which is why both Nats & Labour ( every party , in fact ) are fine with it . thats bs . The ones on 100k + pay double the tax and donate WAY more ... you are sadly deluded . Thats a scarcity and jealous mentality showing The arguement should be why do the govt waste so much money . What we earn should be what we keep in the majority no matter what you earn Correct , the more you earn the more you  re taxed , over 100k earners are taxed at an unfair rate of 33 % which takes a huge chunk of your salary . Sorry earning over 70k is taxed at 33 % so if you  re just over 70k you  re better off earning in the 60s because your tax rate is only 10.5 % so your take home is higher 60s is 30 % i think . 48g up . 48g is SFA , so that's stupid high . Coalition should've moved brackets , but they're tax-mad scum . Yes 48k to 70k is 30 % which should be lowered to 17 % 70k & over is 33 % which it should be raised to people earning over 150 to 33 % 70 to 100k should be 17 % as well why should people earning more pay a higher bracket , they are naturally going to contribute more anyhow ? How is that fair ? Thats greedy ... Look at govt spending , as percentages . It's a simple subsidisation process , kept in motion by valued lobbyists . Revenue take & spend is published regularly . Do your research & pluck out what suits your narrative , as everyone else does . \" Follow the money \" , as we're regularly told . you did not address my question as to why higher earners should have a higher tax bracket , you are deflecting ... Progressive taxation has been a simple aspect of fair societies ( in developed world ) for many decades . Egalitarianism promotes wellbeing in societies , which generates higher local spending , healthier GDP & limits public upheaval . Look around you . The peasants are revolting . is that some sort of copy and paste ?"}

You just keep ignoring the fact that she was selling herself to big donors for 8 hours . :D Actually , no ... she was calling individual donors . Ordinary folks who live in the district , which might be why you didn  t get a call . It  s called phone banking , it  s a normal part of running for office . You guys are so focused on his talking pts , you  re missing the truth . That would be much easier to believe if Christy's past contributions weren't so large and driven by party funding and large contributions . Based on the endorsements that she rolls out , she at best is calling for those and at worst dialing for dollars with big donors . No extremely ignorant rebuke attempts ? Average 2700 per donor in the last two years I  m sure was from everyday working people . You are such a joke . Ignorant ? Ignorance belongs to those who continue to ascribe numbers from an extremely contentious Assembly race against a vile mysoginist sexist opponent ( I can see your confusion ) while working overtime to flip a red district to blue . It worked , in spite of progressive  input .  Smearing maliciously by manipulating context , human nature , and the concept of redemption make you into the first class troll you are today . Thank you for helping the progressive movement grow . For every one of your inane comments there dozens of replies proving your fakeness . Fake ? I  m an actual voter in #CA25 , can you say the same ? Fake when it comes down to your motives . You reek of ulterior ones . Defending a candidate with thousands of dollars average on individual donations vs one that is 27 bucks is the biggest red flag ever . That statement merely shows your complete lack of knowledge about this district . And your complete ability to be snowed by a national power grab . Your guy isn  t for this district , he is for himself . His national profile allows him to get small donations while she works harder . And you are an absolute moron for not believing issues are much bigger than your forced attempts at nativism for the rich and their brown nosers , which requires a national even international working class movement to fix . And you are a moron for believing that a loudmouth YouTube host has the best interest of MY district at heart , as opposed to trying to build his national profile . Note : we are smarter than that . Check the history of this district , we repel carpetbaggers . You are right he has the best interest of the nation and the bona fides to achieve it instead of being alt centrist shills like your kind . Perhaps he should run for Senate then . I hear he believes Kamala Harris is defeatable . There  s no way he wins ... and I  ll be amazed if he makes Top 2 ... But you  re right , you vote for your guy , I  ll vote for mine ... we  ll see how it turns out . You are registered to vote here , right ? How thick are you ? Fighting for a paradigm shift is built on local votes to achieve much higher prosperity for the workers everywhere and to address the income inequality you love championing . Stop trying to distract from the local issues that are intrinsic to the national ones . Again : 1 ) tell him to run for Senate 2 ) tell him to run against in his home district 3 ) tell him to move here and run here in 2 years , when he has contributed to this community 4 ) vote for him , I won  t be , so he needs you Not to mention that there should be a debate on the issues between these candidates . CA25 voters need to know where Christy and Cenk stand on issues and how they respond to policy questions . The voters deserve that but Christy is MIA . Sound democratic ? Hell no ! Why ? So bandstand boy can go off and yell about the things that he will have NO input on , even if he somehow wins the election ?

Save money for retirement - at least 10% of what you earn, gross, in an IRA or employer-sponsored plan. Put it in growth mutual funds or ETFs, and dont touch it until youre satisfied you have enough there to live on no more than 4-5% of the balance per year for the rest of your life. Dont consider individual stocks with this money. 2. Establish a basic budget based on your post-retirement savings income and current expenses. Do not spend more than you bring in on a regular basis. 3. Save a little after-tax money from every paycheck in an FDIC-insured savings account. This is your emergency fund. Dont touch it if youre not in financial dire straits. 4. Once you have at least 3 months of expenses covered by that emergency account, keep saving the money, but flow it to another investment vehicle, such as stocks, bonds, CDs, treasuries, real estate, precious whatever you are comfortable with depending on your goals and risk tolerance that can at least hold value, if not grow it. This is your savings for home, car, vacation, and other major purchases. 5. With the possible exceptions of purchasing a home or borrowing for education that will actually pay for itself, dont take on debt. Pay off your credit cards monthly. Pay your bills on time. 6. If you cant follow the above, take a hard look at your lifestyle. Either find a way to earn more money, spend less money, or both. Second jobs are sometimes necessary, or many people just need to eat out less, go to bars less, drive a cheaper car, or downgrade their living situation. Dont give in trying to impress others or looking good on social media; just do you! Traffic police in Baltimore. I was there this summer and the gridlock was atrocious. People push their way into the intersection, the light turns red, and they are stuck there until the light is about to turn red in the opposite direction, at which point those people push their way into the intersection and the cycle perpetuates. During rush hour, they have police standing in the intersections--not to direct traffic, though, simply to hold their hand up when the light turns red so that people don't push their way into the intersection. Basically, a human has to stand in traffic for hours JUST to tell the drivers what the lights mean. It was unbelievable. Oh god, this reminds me of Atlanta. They have highway signs that tell you how many people have died so far that year in traffic accidents. It's obscene. It was something like just under a thousand people so far this year in August.  And yet everyone still drives like they're the only person on the road so fuck it, why not watch youtube on my phone, swerve between lanes with no advance warning, and tailgate like i'm trying to drive through the other car. It's fucking terrifying and I was only there for three days and now I never want to go back. Ever. Just knowing that there are people who treat five lanes of traffic like it's a goddamn go-kart track makes me want to vomit. I moved to a city and feel like I've become a way worse driver because of this. You can tell me I have the right of way all day long, but I've had enough near misses because people blow through signs to be hesitant to expect people are going to follow regulations. I'm always trying to be on guard but damn will people just come out at you from nowhere. Having the \"right of way\" won't bring me back to life.

My childhood was ruined by those tubey and those weird chewable salmon bones that come in tinned salmon. Never had tinned salmon and now I never will. Fuck that noise. Get some canned salmon and make some beautiful salmon patties. Yeah, it's pretty good breaded and fried. I like it dipped in ketchup, others prefer tartar sauce. In Mississippi folks eat them for breakfast and dip in syrup. Not my particular jam-Ill stick with eggs. My Mom literally made these with eggs for breakfast for me this morning because I'm sick. I asked for oatmeal. Do you eat with syrup? Im an old lady whos never had a salmon croquette. Yes ma'am, she insisted. I haven't had them in ages, and it was delicious. My grandma used to make them with mashed potatoes and creamed peas. Plop down a spoonfull of mashed potatoes, put a fried salmon patty on top, and then a ladle full of creamy peas to top it all off. Yummy. Those were the good ole days."}

{"label":"NOT_SARCASM","text":">Imagine having (a) ... denominator for ... calculations .... Gross.

What difference does it make when Big Tape Measure is lobbying with tens of dollars to keep inches so they don't have to paint more lines? Are tape measures not double-sided like rulers? Most are. Long distance ones (like 50-100 feet) usually have feet, sometimes they'll have decimal feet too which is dumb. Edit: By dumb I mean the decision to include decimal feet instead of a more conventional measurement. Also when working with one like this I would constantly use the wrong measurement (ie 5.8 feet instead of 5 feet 8 inches). Here(<URL> is what most of the tape measurers I have look like. Inches on top, cm on the bottom. > decimal feet too which is dumb. I've never heard that term before but it sure sounds dumb. If your going to go decimal why start with the foot instead of the inch, yard, or mile? It just sounds so incredibly arbitrary. Its used in engineering and architecture for good reason (worked in both) Usually rooms or properties are measured in square feet, so a decimal foot system makes sense when you have to do calculations involving surface area or volume. Imagine having 144 or 1728 in your denominator for surface area or volume calculations on all your buildings. Gross."}

A couple draft spots ? Nice ! ! ! You try winning more than 1 game with Johnny Manziel . <URL> He wasn't their QB , RG3 and Cody Kessler ( 3rd Round ) were . Rememeber Carson Wentz was not a \" Top 20 \" QB Those guys suck too , try winning with any QB from those years was my point . If you go back to ' 16 Draft , when they take a WR and a DE with first two picks . Assuming they wanted the best players available to them at those spots , they could have just taken Joey Bosa ( 1st ) and Michael Thomas ( 2nd ) instead of who they did . How many more games they win now ? Michael Thomas was taken #47 overall . Why are you only ripping the for not drafting him ? Every team in the league passed on him - some teams multiple times . You  re proving my point . He was the 6th WR taken . But according to you , he was CLEARLY the best prospect that year . Opinions varied all over the place . You know #Browns drafted 4 that year right ? None of them named Michael Thomas , Tyreek Hill , or Will Fuller . Any one of those players would have made a difference . Dak Pressott over Cody Kessler would have made a difference . Who the hell would have taken any of those players # 4 overall at the time ?"}

And got the 1000$ taken out of his salary when someone claimed that clause. I think it got removed quickly after. Taken out of his salary? I doubt it was just one dude playing a prank. No, in this case the amount was left unspecified in the EULA so the company could send a dollar or a million. Company chose the 1k themselves, and happily sent it off for the cheap publicity. Not to mention that it's illegal to punish employees that way."}

Here , leading feminist thinkers told BuzzFeed News why feminism should include trans people . <URL> One of the problems with biology , when discussing feminism and trans people , is where it leads , said Prof . Akwugo Emejulu . <URL>  This has always been the dark heart of white , feminist politics : a jealous guarding of the boundaries of who gets to be a woman , said Prof . Emejulu She cited several examples of white feminists excluding women from ethnic minorities , but began with the earliest . <URL> This continues to the present day , she said .  Boundary making is what  s crucial here .  Therefore , she said , excluding trans people is a way of keeping one  s position or status . <URL> Keeping trans women out is , Prof . Sally Hines said ,  regulating who can belong to a category in order to close down membership , in order to protect the rights of a dominant majority white women  . Prof . Emejulu & Prof . Vanita Sundaram argue that for feminism to really deliver equality & emancipation , it must also focus on problems women face as a result of oppression on basis of factors other than their sex : in particular race , class , sexuality , disability , & gender identity . <URL> Prof . Sundaram :  My own research area is violence vs women & girls , and we know that trans women are more vulnerable to violence , harassment , and everyday abuse than other groups of women . So as a feminist and academic , it  s my responsibility to advocate for that group of women .   So it has to be a feminism that challenges patriarchy and other systems of hierarchy that are used to oppress , gender identity being one of them ,  Prof . Sundaram . <URL> One of the reasons that a war over trans rights has raged more intensely among feminists in the U . K . than in the US , said Prof . Alison Phipps , is  the blame has been put on to the wrong group , and trans people are carrying the can for problems that are not of their making .  <URL> The idea that simplifying trans women  s legal recognition would lead to increase in attacks in toilets or prisons was unfounded . Prof . Phipps said evidence doesn  t show trans women to be anything like as sexually violent as men ... while instead being even more likely to be victims <URL> Painting trans women as predators when they are routinely victims is unjust . And because perceived threat is not the same as actual threat , policies should be  based on actual levels of risk , which are low ,  Prof Phipps ."}

No it isn't compound debt from Labour . Tories have more than doubled the debt . By the 7th year of this tory government , they had borrowed more than every Labour government combined , despite Labour's borrowing including the bank bail out . OK , Daniel . I realise now I'm talking to an expert in macro economics . Tell me , where did the National debt go in 2010 ? 1997 , Tory debt = 42 % Before the crash 2007 debt = 36 % 16 % Fall After 2007 , as in every recession , income fell because consumers cut back Expenditure went up because unemployment went up . So , with expenditure rising & income falling the debt increased to 52 % lowest in the G7 <URL> Forget % , the hard figures , show the tories have more than doubled the debt since they've been in gov , They've borrowed more than every Labour governement combined , while increasing the poverty amoung those they're supposed to be working for .

I agree they've handled it badly but they did not create this mess . Never mind sniping , what debt pile are you refering to ? What do you mean ' what debt pile ' ? The National debt of course .

Yet you can't see what's right in front of you , nor have you yet addressed it in any rational way . There was a mess debt when the tories took over . The annual deficit was something like 180bn . What do you expect would happen to the size of the ND ? Even if they eradicated deficit by now , that would have added nearly 1Tn to the debt . You keep repeating \" mess \" . What sort of mess ? In what way was there a \" mess \" of debt ? The tories have doubles it , but whe the tories do it , it isn't a \" mess of debt \" ? Until you've confirmed your basic understanding of deficit and debt I see little to be gained by carrying this on . You mean you can't justify your sound bites about the \" mess of debt Labour left us with \" . You repeated the headlines , without know what it actually means . Daniel , I know what it means .

But it needs saying . We've just lived through a period in which many charged with protecting British Jews have done the exact opposite . I'm referring here especially to the Chief Rabbi , Board of Deputies and Jewish Chronicle . Completely in the face of the evidence , a narrative was created by the media , and doubled down on by those I mention above . This narrative blamed those who can always be found on the front line fighting AGAINST all forms of racism for antisemitism . At the same time , as antisemitism on the right and far right rose , rose and rose some more , the response was ... nothing . Nothing whatsoever . The organisations and individuals I've referred to above simply DO NOT CARE about most Jews . That's what their record shows . And as they do not care about most Jews , the following is likely to happen : 1 . Any attacks such as the latest awful ones will be blamed on the left , regardless of reality . 2 . This will cause ever more panic among British Jews . 3 . If any left wing Jews are attacked , heaven help them . Because as their record proves , those whose responsibility it is to protect them will do not the slightest thing . 4 . Antisemitism will continue to rise from the far right : whose existence is being normalised . Don't expect the individuals and organisations I mentioned in the OP to magically come to their senses . THEY DON'T CARE . Least of all about anyone poor , disabled , vulnerable , or left wing . Already , we've seen an online campaign to somehow blame these latest atrocities on the left . Already , we are seeing absurd , revolting attempts to paint Bernie Sanders as an antisemite . This will only get worse . The only cure is education and solidarity . #NoPasaran When Michael Rosen - MICHAEL ROSEN ! ! - is persistently attacked and smeared for the crime of caring with all his heart for all his fellow Jews ( and for humanity itself ) , what's going on here couldn't be clearer . Not least when the person insulting him is followed by blue ticks . The past 3 years or so have seen the most hysterical , disgusting campaign of smears and lies I have ever known in British politics or British public life . That's not going to magically stop now . Facts no longer matter . Evidence no longer matters . Those responsible for this are interested only in the following : 1 . Attention ( in the case of celebrities ) 2 . Clicks and newspaper sales ( in the case of the Jewish Chronicle ) 3 . The defeat of the left None of them are remotely interested in the defeat of antisemitism . They couldn't be less so . And you know how I know that ? Because Britain has a prime minister who personally profited from antisemitism for YEARS ... and these organisations rejoiced in his victory . The House of Commons , meanwhile , has a leader who has repeatedly propagated horrendous antisemitic tropes ; as has the prime minister's special adviser . Again : none of them say a single damn word . The Jewish Chronicle has been referred by IPSO for sanctions due to its false , evidence-free demonisation of a Labour activist , after an investigation with which it refused to cooperate . This is far from the first time it's been in trouble either . And the Chief Rabbi himself makes an outrageous intervention into an election campaign to inquire about Britain's ' moral compass ' ... while the poor get poorer , disabled people take their own lives , and austerity claims hundreds of thousands of victims . Under the party he backs . Sam Kriss refers to all of this as the war against the Jews . He's right . And what he had to say should be read by all . <URL> But as Sam Kriss is a left wing Jew , for these people and these organisations , he's therefore the wrong kind of Jew . Or even , a non-Jew . Because goodness knows , voices like his , Rosen's or so many others must at all costs be drowned out by nonsense and hysteria . Down this road lies absolute catastrophe . When so-called civilised societies abandon evidence , abandon reason , abandon any sense whatsoever of community , solidarity or the ties which bind us all , catastrophe is always what results . And when it does , those responsible for this disgusting campaign will , I'm sure , continue to blame the left ... even as the left does everything in its power to help . Orwell and 1984 , eat your heart out .     Labour opened its doors to any crank & thug with \u00a3 3 in his bin , gave them all a vote & ended up with the cranks in charge . Until it puts this right , it will be blamed for the consequences . It  s not * hard *"}

As someone who has a foot in both camps ( Bernie 2020 & the YangGang ) I can tell you this is nothing but a nasty smear against a natural ally and POTENTIAL VOTERS . <URL> Yang is not a natural ally , he's pro capitalism and wants to reinforce it with placative measures to keep the poor from realizing class consciousness . He actively opposes leftist ideology . If you truly do not support Yang that  s OK . But time is better spent getting politically disengaged citizens to vote rather than trying to smear or attack other candidates and their supporters . There are millions of people who don  t vote but can . Let  s focus our efforts on that . I'm focusing my efforts on getting people to vote for bernie sanders because he is the only leftist candidate , spreading class consciousness , ensuring that all people are provided for , and building a coalition of the working class . That's really awesome , keep at it ! I hope you understand from my point of view how your tweet came off . I don't think we should point fingers at each other . Remember when Hillary basically blamed Bernie for losing ( heck she still does ) ? It's just not the attitude we should have the issue is that yang supporters do not understand the concept of leftism and the struggle against the ruling class . i'm attacking yang because he fundamentally opposes leftism and supports right libertarian ideals Regardless of how you might label his policies , most Americans would benefit the mist from them . That  s the problem I tend to see amongst Bernie supporters , you can  t seem to separate ideology from practicality . the problem is in the yang gangs lack of critical analysis of yang's plans . UBI funded by VAT is the poor paying themselves , and also the rich , it's regressive as hell . it also does nothing to benefit those already receiving the bare minimum in SSI \/ SSDI 40 hour week , 48 weeks , that's a total of another $ 28k between 2 adults . Total projected income after UBI ? 52k . You not even gonna convince yourself that UBI isn't a better option . UBI is great . UBI payed for by taxing consumption and eliminating welfare programs is not great , it is a placative measure to perpetuate the latest stages of capitalism . Again , if you were to criticize UBI , at least get your facts right . UBI does not eliminate any existing welfare programs . allow me to correct my semantic error . UBI is great . YANG'S VERSION OF UBI payed for by taxing consumption and SLOWLY eliminating welfare programs is not great , it is a placative measure to perpetuate the latest stages of capitalism . Also funny how so suddenly people have always had an ideal version of UBI until confronted with Yang  s , the only candidate to ever propose the policy and to essentially propel it into mainstream politics .

The guy's mouth is bloodied; looks like they may have hit him in the face, which may be why he's prone as they drag him off (or he could be passively resisting).
