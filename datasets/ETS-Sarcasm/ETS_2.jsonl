Same thing with Nike. They had that Kaepernick campaign and now they\u2019ve taken down Rockets shit in China The Kaepernick move was financially motivated since they know a large segment of their base is urban and represents people of color. They realized the benefits would outweigh the costs It was capitalism disguised as progressivism. Likewise, the removal of the Rockets store in China is also financially motivated, albeit to appease the their Chinese market base. Two sides of the same coin. My advice: Don't ever put too much loyalty in a brand. A lot of these companies that seem to be doing things for the betterment of society actually are driven by money and ulterior motives. And when money and morality clash, money usually wins. Anyone who thinks Nike didn't do extensive market research before deciding to support Kaepernick in the campaign is lying to themselves. They knew supporting him would make them money, if it didn't, they wouldn't have supported him, bottom line literally and figuratively."}

Here I was thinking he had learned about it during an intelligence briefing or something. Nope, sitting on his watching TV to see if anyone says his name. I think that\u2019s one of the things that irks me when stories like this come out about Trump. He watches Fox & Friends, Hannity, CNN, and a host of other shit. He\u2019s the head of arguably one the best intelligence communities in the world but chooses to get info from CNN and Fox News. There was a story that came out about intelligence leaders upset at Obama\u2019s PC meetings. What Fox News ran with was this was Obama having too many political correctness meetings. Instead they were Principals Committee meetings that involved top NSC officials. Obama wanted to know what the fuck was going on to the point his intelligence heads thought he was micromanaging. With Trump it\u2019s been alleged that he just lets them do their thing without much interaction. LMAO so they thought Obama was sat their talking about which pro-nouns are acceptable for trans people or some shit. > EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story accurately quoted the book as describing \"PC\" as standing for \"politically correct\" in characterizing certain Obama administration meetings. The author has since informed Fox News this was due to a misunderstanding between him and his source and that the initials referred to \"Principals Committee.\" <URL>"}

I was a foreign student in the USA and the worst nightmare for foreign students is to end up in the hospital. One of my friend was walking across the zebra crossing and one dude ran the red light and hit my friend. He was just shocked and traumatized. Only have few bruises and he was instructed to stay on the ground until the ambulance came and bring him to hospital. He was totally find but still had an x-ray and some check ups thay added up to a total of $15,000 bill. Lucky him his bills was covered by the driver\u2019s insurance. Lesson learned! 1 hospital trip = game over! Most people just don't pay it Thats how people get into debts \ud83d\ude02 but really, the cost is just so shocking. One time I had a slight fever or sick i dont remember and decided to go clinic to get some medicine. At that time i didnt know people in the US mostly just go to pharmacy and get their own fix where in my country we\u2019d just visit clinic and get some medicine (~$10-$25 per visit for private clinic, government operated costs like $0.33 per visit with medicine) So i consult the doctor and was in there for few mins. Checked my pulse etc and i was just sick and no big problems. The doctor then asked me to drink lots of water and remember to take medicine regularly. Paid $275. I'm doing online diagnosis now. Hey you! Drink some water! That'll be 300$, thank you very much. You gotta need a doctors license first before you attempt to rob me legally \ud83d\ude06"}

","context":" FIFA has decided that teams whose supporters are guilty of racist behaviour automatically forfeit the match if the referee decides to abandon it Effective on Monday this rule will apply to all FIFA competitions, both international and national. A match can be cancelled and resulted in a loss only after the referee has applied the three-step procedure which includes the speaker making a warning to the fans and the referee making a temporary break. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this give the officials another reason not to suspend play? That three steps process is already in effect, right? And it's never used even without this punitive addition. So why does this make it better?"}

This meant stopping at your locker every 2 periods and having to carry 2 heavy textbooks, two notebooks\/binders and any workbooks or additional books you needed for the classes. The school was enormous. We had 3 floors where most of the classes were, in the shape of a square, with 4 stairwells. Each floor had roughly 60 classrooms, my locker was on the 3rd floor with most of my classes on the 1st and 2nd. There were also 2400 kids in the school so the hallways and stairwells were packed and we only had 4-5 minutes in between class. It was nearly impossible to get to class in time between the crowded halls and huge layout, and stopping at my locker made it even harder. Plus 3 tardies in any class counted as an absense for the day. If we had been allowed to carry backpacks it would have been so much easier. I went to a shitty public middle school and we weren't allowed to carry bags or go to our lockers except for during home room.

They don't want to actually run the company, they want more money and \"a say\" in running the company which they describe as \"ownership\". The disagreement between the two sides is muddied by differing uses of the words and their definitions. It's very similar to the example of when someone argues that democracy is the ultimate \"power by the people\", and then AnCaps point out flaws in the definition of \"consent\", \"power\", \"people\", etc. They don\u2019t even describe it as ownership. Ownership does not exist in a communist society. There are some flavours of socialism that argue for co-op ownership for all employees.

Its a huge issue. Literally every conflict could have been resolved so much more simply. Why are there even space laser weapons when a teakettle strapped to a warp drive could destroy the death star. Why is there anything when warp drives can take out every spacefaring vessel extremely easily. Why does this scene exist. I hate it. None of the battle tactics involve any common sense, that whole scene where they lost all their bombers with one blast wasn't well thought out. And I have NEVER seen a ship in starwars go that slow.

I would only go shell in a few scenarios: 1: You have healing on your team, so you know the enemy will build anti-heal later. 2: The enemy has a character like Bakasura that is heavily affected by upgraded shell. 3: You are running double tank into a hunter and the other tank is buying med.

Of course , faith must be chosen later in life , but even then the baptism imparts grace that pulls one towards that faith . @USER @USER Well , precise pinning down of election isn \u2019 t really a thing for classical Anglicanism . The BCP and Articles predate the Armenian \/ Calvinist debates . @USER @USER Right , but now we are living past those debates so we need to be able to refine our language to dialogue with modern questions . @USER @USER It \u2019 s like living after Nicea and being like \u201c well x church \u2019 s tradition predates the Arian controversy so they really don \u2019 t have a developed Trinitarian theology \u201d @USER @USER Except that \u2019 s one is an issue of heresy and the other is an issue of intra-Reformed doctrinal precision . My argument is that such precision isn \u2019 t as necessary for our tradition as some would have it .

But the harder stuff from Scotland and the Netherlands ... I mean , he didn't even like that in his own lifetime ... @USER @USER @USER Well , isn't that just the genius of the English and Irish churches in stopping later followers taking reformed doctrine too far ? @USER @USER @USER The part that's very strange is that the Welsh Calvinist tradition leans in that direction , despite the extreme oddness of its history . @USER @USER @USER Well , Calvinistic Methodism is just inherently so v odd ."}

So it's this good or bad?? This! I remember it like it happened yesterday. I was in warangal at that time and the exact same thing happened. We obviously knew it was a fake encounter then, as it is now."}

{"label":"NOT_SARCASM","text":"@USER Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year \u2019 s Eve !","context":" 1 . I \u2019 ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I \u2019 ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is \u201c razor thin \u201d . 2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that \u2019 s just \u201c business as usual \u201d for Suleimani ) 3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader \u2019 s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything . 4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran \u2019 s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy . 5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap . 6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the \u201c far out option \u201d 7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL> 8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official . 9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : <URL> 10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they \u2019 re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far . 11 . But among the \u201c menu options \u201d that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . <URL> 12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias 13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to @USER for insight . He \u2019 s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America \u2019 s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq : 14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US \u2019 posture in Iraq 15 . \u201c It \u2019 s all been downhill , \u201d @USER told me , in terms of America \u2019 s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces 16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked . 17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one \u2019 s trying to downplay Suleimani \u2019 s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga ."}

Eventually, they WILL give you what you want. They also put me on indefinite hold a few of those times I called but I just redialed their 1800 number. You just have to be the bigger asshole and you'll learn all the ins and outs, and then it'll be a pleasant experience from them on. There's also local divisions for every one of those departments so all of the support is there, just hidden away behind the special deals department, which 99% of calls are routed to. Just act like you're really tired of their shit but do it in a kindly fashion and maybe they'll give you the real support number. deleted"}

Damian is on his way to work . It's been a busy few weeks for the family . His wife Mary , 35 , is at home with their daughter and new 2 week old baby , Noah . It's two days before Christmas . Horrified , Damian sees from the iPad that his daughter is holding , that his wife Mary has collapsed to the ground . She is not moving . She can't speak . He quickly calls family members who live next door . They race to the house , calling an ambulance along the way . An ambulance arrives . The paramedics suspect Mary has suffered a stroke . Within 15 minutes they are on the way to CUH . They pre-alert the Emergency Department and the CUH stroke team , who are waiting at the door as the ambulance arrives . Mary is seen immediately by the Emergency Medicine and Stroke Teams together . She has suffered a catastrophic stroke . She can't speak . She can't swallow . She can't see properly . She is paralysed down her right hand side . Advanced imaging shows that Mary has torn her left carotid artery , the main blood vessel bringing blood from her heart , through her neck to her brain . Worse still , she has also blocked the left middle cerebral artery - the main blood vessel with the brain itself . <URL> Mary is critically ill . There is no blood getting to the left hand side of her brain . At just 35 , this stroke will either kill her or leave her with severe disability , requiring nursing home care . The chances of her returning back home to her young family are no more than 5 % . <URL> But , Mary has come to CUH - the busiest inpatient stroke centre in Ireland and 1 of just 2 hospitals in the country , that can provide stroke thrombectomy - the ability to acutely remove the blood clot causing the stroke . Mary is immediately prepped for an emergency thrombectomy . Consultant Interventional NeuroRadiologists Dr . Gerry Wyse and Dr . Noel Fanning , along with their team , quickly rebuild Mary's torn carotid artery using 3 special stents . They then remove the blood clot further up in her brain . She has been in hospital less than 1 hour . Mary is transferred to the Stroke Unit under Consultant Neurologist , Dr . Aine Merwick . The team , and Mary's family wait to see if the procedure has been clinically successful . Within 24 hours , Mary can speak again . Within a few days she can wash and dress herself . Within a week , Mary has no discernible stroke deficits . She can walk and talk , eat and drink , laugh and cry . She leaves hospital a little over a week later , stopping on the way with her husband Damian , to again meet the team that saved her life . <URL> I was't directly involved in Mary's care but I am enormously proud of the skill and dedication of my colleagues here in CUH who were able to save her life . She came to our hospital , our stroke service , at the most critical time in her life and received emergency care that is comparable to any hospital in the world . There hasn't been any clinical intervention in medicine within the last decade as effective as stroke thrombectomy . Uniquely , for medical advances , it is also hugely cost effective , with large reductions in rehab and social care costs . We have performed 77 thrombectomies in CUH in 2019 , a 50 % increase on previous years . We have treated patients from Cork , Kerry , Tipperary , Limerick , Waterford and Clare .

I'm afraid you've been misled . @USER @USER @USER Tells us why it would be beneficial for Scotland stay in the union ? I mean anything would be good ... \ud83d\udc42 ! ! ? ? ? ! @USER @USER @USER The pooling and sharing of resources that means that when different parts of the UK do well , they can fund those parts doing less well , and ensure public services are maintained . In the 80s and early 90s Scotland was a net contributor , in the years since we have had net benefit . @USER @USER @USER London Docklands was unproductive wasteland in 1980s . Investments from rest of country resulted in development and is now massive contributor to UK revenues including to Scotland . @USER @USER @USER Total bollocks both of you . Scotland , like many regions of England has been starved of investment and any joined up economic planning . The only for Scotland to prosper is to take control of our own resources . Pooling and sharing is a myth . @USER @USER @USER Economic planning is devolved . You should complain to the SNP . Independence means losing billions of pounds a year . Pooling and sharing is very , very real and we'd find out the hard way if we dividing the UK as you want to . @USER @USER @USER Really ? The Scottish gov decided to invest billions in HS2 , London Crossrail , the Olympics development , Trident renewal , tax breaks for oil companies etc . Scotland is a wealthy country with enormous potential . @USER @USER @USER Too many myths ( HS2 , Crossrail , Olympics etc ) to bother with there . And infrastructure investment in any part of the economy benefits whole economy through added productivity . @USER @USER @USER Myths ? More nonsense . You don't think direct investment in Scotland on the scale there has been in SE England would be of greater benefit to the Scottish economy ? @USER @USER @USER As I've pointed out before the fiscal transfer is a myth . Even if it were true don't you think it would be a better idea to have an economic policy the whole country would benefit from ? @USER @USER @USER The whole country does benefit . That's what the map shows . Haven't you got a march to go to ? @USER @USER @USER So the whole country would benefit from investing in Scotland instead wouldn't it ? As for marches we can get tens of thousands to march on a terrible day like this the union can't get anyone except your pals in the OO to March in the middle of summer . @USER @USER @USER We don't organise marches . We don't want to change Scotland's place in the UK ."}

This ever expanding ... @USER @USER Does Netherlands understand where they are in comparison with \u201c empires \u201d like the US & China ? Does Netherlands are completely self sufficient ? @USER @USER Straw man , practically no one is against economic cooperation , for that a majority would be easy . That however is held hostage to force ideological points down member states ' throats like open borders and giving up soverntny . For that there is no majority and Brussels knows it . @USER @USER ` open borders and giving up sovereignty ` - observe the UK to see how ` borders and sovereignty ` will be regained . @USER @USER How do you see the UK ending up in such dire straits if they are allowed to trade normally like now ? @USER @USER The UK cannot trade ` normally like now ` without alignment ( only for business purposes ) to the EU rules and regulations . <URL> @USER @USER OK if the UK does not want to align then they sort themselves out . But the original dispute under Cameron was they wanted that just control over their borders which was perfectly reasonable . This EU is a tied-in sale of what countries obviously want with something a majority ... @USER @USER Cameron has wanted more - ` something ` to do with money , tax havens and etc . The UK still have no cap for none-EU immigration and are happy about the fact #SpoilerAlert : negotiation of trade deals with various counties @USER @USER The main reason that thses things are an issue is because Brussels knows other states will want the same thing . So why not give it to everyone ? B \/ c they would be out of a job . This is about petty politics at the expense of the peoples of Europe and it's time we put a stop to it . @USER @USER ` other states will want ` . Anti-Europeanism is quite old ideology . There were 100s of European politicians familiar with and in favour of . Sanity has preserved European Unity . <URL> <URL> <URL> @USER @USER That is not anti-europeanism , that is taking the cooperation in Europe of as far as member states are conformable to take it . If you had a valid counter point , you would have made it by now . You know I'm right . @USER @USER Euroscepticism is hijacked by anti-Europeanism ( Love Europe hate EU ) . Eurosceptics won ` t inflict self damage to very own countries for ` sovereignty econ prosperity ` reasons . Brexit is geopolitical and military choice , not economical one . All my convo with you is MY VALID point . @USER @USER Except for the fact that's not how this went down . The UK left after Merkel unilaterally invited 2 million people and then shoved them down everyone's throat through a majority vote for the first time , stopping the unanimous votes of before . That custom was abandoned to shove ... @USER @USER foreigners across borders , a flagrant transgression of sovernty . That's how this went down and people have not forgotten , although this is conspicuously absent from the news . @USER @USER Thanks Mr . Obvious . Xenophobia has played a massive role in Brexit . Same time , Xenophobia is used as a tool by US anti-Europeanists since the US is ` more diverse society ` ( - ghetto society IMHO ) . Anyway , there will be benefits for the EU in 40 years from those 2 mill invitees . @USER @USER Guarding the borders is not xenofobic , it the duty of the state . You are terribly misguided about this . Homo sapiens is a nasty primate and mixing groups has not gone particularly well 100 % of the time , to put it mildly ."}

John Howard's best legacy by a very long way. Props to him. Edit: my top comment of all time and it's in praise of John Howard. -_- Kind of awkward however as Bob Brown had been proposing similar legislation in Tasmania for almost a decade before the PA Massacre... Howard could be accused of just jumping on the opportunity.. I saw Howard on Compass discussing the ban, he was very candid that he absolutely did take the opportunity that Port Arthur presented. His take was that it was a very politically damaging move in normal circumstances, if he didn't seize the sentiment of the moment it wouldn't have happened (from his party anyway). That's politics I guess, and Howard was good at grabbing opportunities. Great of him to realise and admit that the aftermath of a massacre is the perfect time to discuss gun control."}

Especially since treyarch said that they wouldnt go the same route as AW. This is just like \"FUCK YOU LAST STAND\" all over again... If they're gonna add weapons, make people do a series of challenges to get them. An example is - Play 20 games of CTF, get 20 headshots with the Shieva, and get a double kill wih C4. Once you complete these three challenges, you unlock a \"key\" to unlock one of the new weapons. then the challenges refresh and have new tasks to do. Its too late now but whatever. They could have killed two birds with one stone like this because this idea is basically \"Contracts\" from the OG Blops, which many people on this subreddit have asked for. Yes, if they're going to put new weapons into the game, it can't just be RNG.. And what sucks is that the challenge system I suggested would help the game out so much. People would play the underpopulated modes for the new weapons if they get a contract that requires them to. Unfortunately its not what makes them money I thought that was good idea in the first Blops where you could set contracts to earn credits and stuff it's how I found headquaters.

Completely agree with this. In my hometown there was a friend of mine who was accused of raping an underage girl. If remember correctly he was 19 and she was 16, and she claimed rape. In my county there is a bookings website where you can see who was booked for what crimes for the past week. This led to his mugshot being in the local paper, him getting death threats on social media, etc, etc. But when the trial came she admitted to lying about it because her parents would be mad if they found out she was having premarital sex. Was there an article in the newspaper about that? Of course not. He was basically exiled from the area because nobody would hire this \u201crapist\u201d who turned out to be completely innocent. He seems to be doing fine now, living in a different area all together, but I\u2019m sure that experience was extraordinarily traumatic for him in the first place (going to jail, court, investigation, all of that) and then being shunned by the entire community. Which brings up how I disagree with the bookings webpage in general but that\u2019s a topic for a different thread."}

{"label":"SARCASM","text":"Well then they should get a pc so things load faster ","context":" Fat chance console wont beat us. I believe it\u2019s honestly impossible to truly beat pc because we can constantly upgrade and improve as new tech comes out. Also customization. Obviously. This is a fact. I still don't understand how some console gamers give the excuse that console is better I think you are looking at this from a different point of view of those who prefer consoles. I have a PS4 pro, Switch and a PC. Imo, PC is still my platform of choice but both the Switch and PS4 pro have advantages depending on what you prefer and are looking for in a platform to play games. There are a lot of people that do not want to bother with building a PC and just want a simple system where you put the game and play. Many also don't care about customization or about other non-gaming features that a PC offers (many of these people already have a PC to work for example) And yes, PC gaming these days is more convenient than ever, but it's still not as convenient as a console. With a console you don't have to worry about specs, what graphics settings you should use, messing around with them until you find the sweet spot for your framerates, etc (this is one of the reasons why I think the Steam Machine flopped, it offered too many options and was poorly advertised, it just confused people) Steam sales are also no longer a big advantage point for PC because PSN also offers pretty good deals every now and again. Eshop on the other hand sucks on that front. Speaking of sales, you can pick up a ps4 slim or pro for pretty good prices when they are on sale. You can grab a slim for 200 euros or less. And a lot of AAA exclusives in these systems are must play for gamers. They offer great gameplay and stories, great experiences and without bashing you with MX and loot boxes. Personally, I think platform wars are fun as a joke, but they are extremely dumb if you take them seriously. The better platform is ultimately subjective. It depends on what you want from a platform Bro, you descibed choice based on need and features. Sometimes the people that prefer consoles have only a couch, 2 hours max to a game or netflix before the next work day. So you totally make sense."}

{"label":"NOT_SARCASM","text":"I was thinking more like a surveillance audit <URL>","context":" United Nations official visiting Alabama to investigate great poverty and inequality Finally the kinds of things these people go through is coming to light. Everyone on this site, and in general, always likes to make fun of Alabama and Mississippi because of their poverty and lack of education, but at the end of the day, these are human beings. My dad comes from a poor family in Mississippi and many relatives lived there, so I\u2019ve seen firsthand how bad it is for some people. And before anyone dismissed them as rednecks, just understand that breaking out of that cycle of poverty or even trying to break out of it is almost impossible given the circumstances in the state. I don\u2019t pretend to know hoe to solve this problem, but this article that\u2019s so shocking to many simply reports on what a lot of people spend their entire lives enduring. I hope that instead of dismissing and making fun of them we can begin to find ways to improve these areas. Sorry for the rant, it\u2019s just heartbreaking to be reminded of this and what my grandfather\/great grandfather had to endure growing up there. To be fair, most large countries have areas of poverty. This could just as easily have been Flint, Michigan about water quality or the Great Plains about technology access or the Deep South about poverty and literacy. This title says \"Alabama\" because it's hosted on al.com, Alabama local news. The tour also includes Atlanta and Washington D.C. and several other places. >he'll be looking at...\"government efforts to eradicate poverty in the country, and how they relate to US obligations under international human rights law\" I think this line is key to why the investigation is happening at this time and in these places. In Flint, even if the government still sucked, there were efforts that fell under US obligations. The rapporteur will be seeing if the US has made any efforts in the areas of investigation. I wonder how routine this is. Does his visit signal a more serious problem, or is it standard surveillance? deleted"}

{"label":"NOT_SARCASM","text":"their conditioning , and most of all , nurture this love and not let it go . They must recognize the blessing , the miracle that it is to have found their other spiritual half . #life #spirituallove #sufilove","context":" Life has many difficulties and many needs that one wants to fulfill . Some regrets and sorrows too from the past that one gets used to walking with , keeping company . But for someone who has lacked love and acceptance on so many levels all throughout life , My life is complete with two things . First and foremost , someone that loves me as I am , unconditionally . Someone in whom I find a home in . My one true love . And second , my health so I can enjoy this life in love . Everything else is just background noise . If I have these two things , I do not mourn the things lost , I do not fear whats to come , not even death . And I definitely do not fear failure , failure in anything . Because my every step leads to him . In my intoxication of my beloved , I don't even see myself falling and getting up repeatedly , I just proceed toward him in my drunken state . And I strongly believe that when you let this kind of love enter your life fully and unabashedly , you evolve as a human being , as a spiritual being , and when you've got a direct line to the divine , everything around you flourishes , blooms , the good multiplies , abundance knocks at your door . This is one of the ways , for me personally being the superior way , to realize your full potential . When the masculine and the feminine come together in perfect harmony , without any hesitation or resistance , everything else falls in place . But you must not resist this love for it requires you to disrobe the defense systems you've put in place . You must thank your survival instincts and put them aside . It is time to ascend . It requires you to let go of many things that hold you back but you are attached to them nonetheless . They may have served you well in the past , but there is no need for them now . You must submit fully to this kind of love . Your whole life , as tragic as it may be , has lead you to this point . Be grateful for your tragedies especially . This type of love may overwhelm you and scare you at first . you may fear losing control . You may be miserable in your pangs of separation ( hijr ) . You may cry the sorrows of a lifetime . Did you think it was going to be easy , this all-encompassing love ? You do realize you had to be cleansed of your patterns , of your set in stone thought systems , of your ego . You will definitely be miserable for a while . Like a seed , you must break down from the core to bring out the sacred Life in you . But there is a landfall at the other end of this deep turbulent ocean You will reach a calm if you allow yourself to stop struggling & just let go . You will come to a point where you are fully present , fully aware of yourself . you'll see your beloved everywhere . How many times have you read , exploring different spiritual thoughts , how important it is to become a witness to self ? And you will , finally . You'll see yourself through your beloved's eyes . There is nothing you'll do , that will not be witnessed . you'll have fallen in love with yourself in exchange . They say , you must learn to love yourself in order to love another But what if it can also be the other way around ? what if you learn t love and care fr yourself through your love for another . Is it so wrong ? It doesn't feel that way . I think this is one way to find God because true unadulterated love is just that , across the board . There are no labels once it surpasses a certain depth . Ibaadat mein bhi nikhaar aayega . Your spiritual practice will come into clarity . For many of us , we must have some sort of spiritual practice \/ discipline \/ ritual ( whatever you want to call it ) in order to journey through this love , in order to ascend and not fall . How is it that you can witness God through something sacred such as true love ? I think you can . It is possible that the deeper you go in love , the higher you rise to meet Eternity . But yes , I can see that some sort of ritual or practice is necessary to not veer off or get distracted from the path of love . You may argue that such lovers only meet a tragic end . #sufilovers Yes , they do in stories that you hear . Would you read a story about a couple that lives together in love for the rest of their lives ? It would become just another children's fairy tale . for a love story to shake you spiritually , it has to have a tragic end , namely death , to realize that it goes beyond this lifetime , death being just a stage . But there are lovers that live happily ever after . That old couple walking slowly before you , supporting each other , the one sipping tea \/ coffee at the same cafe every day , the one that you read about that died within moments of each other , holding hands , or the young couple that finds solace and peace in each other's arms after a hard day's work . Any one of them could be a divine \/ sacred couple . What did you think they walk around with halos above them ? or some spotlight shining on them ? not all enlightened souls become gurus and start giving discourses . many if not most , just live small , peaceful ( mostly ) , lives of domestic bliss as they grow together through their conflicts and spiritually , live the mysteries of Life \/ Existence together hand in hand . having said all this , its sad that not everyone finds that one true love . It can't be just anyone . It can't be produced out of nothing . Somehow the whole universe must work together to bring two people together that belong together in such a way . It is by the grace of God that these two find each other journeying through lifetimes . And once they're brought together by some divine intervention , they must recognize the signs , accept , work on"}

I was a surprise Honeymoon baby born 9 months and a day after their wedding, I was regularly screamed at for anything I did until I just started hiding, I was called \"the practice child\" my whole life, my younger siblings got way more love and attention, etc. In my teens they started taking in \"strays\". If any neighborhood kids didn't want to go home, they could just be at our house all the time. Effectively, my mother would take my friends away from me to be *HER* friends instead. One of which was a kid who picked on me constantly from the time I was 11. I guess they had that in common. That guy was kicked out of his Dad's house AND his mom's house when he was 20, so my parents took him in permanently. That killed me. But I always wanted their approval, so I was always calm and agreeable, always desperately trying to figure out how to get them to love me, so I went along with it. Years later, I'm married and have a son. This guy still lives with my parents. They continue to coddle and make excuses for him while criticising me for whatever they feel like. One day, we're all at my parents house and my son is being a goofy 2-year-old, which annoys the man-child living there. So he gets furious, picks my son up by his ankle and spanks him. My parents claimed not to have seen it. We went home. I couldn't sleep that night because I was so upset. The next morning, I made sure the guy and my mom would be at home (and why wouldn't he be there) and I went to confront them with my wife. I dumped ***everything*** I had been putting up with on them for about an hour, including asking how my mom could allow this jerk to hit my son. She maintained that it didn't happen, so I went through the roof. I ended up crying because of all the pent-up emotion, so my fantastic wife took over. She said we wouldn't be coming back if the guy still lived there, so he yelled that he would move out and he stormed off after saying he didn't have to listen to this. My parents convinced him ***not*** to move out shortly after we left. My mother expressed how disappointed she was that I didn't come \"to have a conversation\", and only came to \"dump\" on them. ***THAT*** was her big takeaway from everything I said. That I wasn't being \"fair\" to them. We went to counseling with them later. For months. It validated everything I had felt, but they never stopped lying and being defensive. One counselor said we should be on Dr. Phil. The other counselor said my mom is \"incapable of empathy\". Both counselors called my parents delusional. But of course my parents didn't take any of that seriously. At one point my dad asked me \"Who does he think he is to judge us like that?\", as if he forgot that THAT'S THEIR JOB. Haven't spoken with them in almost a year, and life is so much better."}

{"label":"SARCASM","text":"But does WWE have enough content for off season. ","context":" Jim Cornette on Twitter: On John Olivers WWE report: Well, after a complete viewing, this is the absolute most truthful outside media piece Ive seen on wrestling in over 40 years. Roddy Piper's quote in particular hit home, explaining that there is no exit plan for wrestlers. He said he didn't think he'd make 65 and he didn't. The lack of consistent healthcare for wrestlers working 5 nights a week is an atrocity. Every major sport in the U.S. has an off-season period for athletes to recover physically and mentally. The WWE is brutally year round non stop 5 days week. Get injured? Well wishes...and good luck having the company support you with a push after that EDIT: This doesn't even account for the number of WWE legends struggling to even live properly these days The offseason idea makes so much sense, too. If they have a rotating cycle where different guys are off at different times, fans will pretty much never even notice and then someone comes back and instantly has heat again just because they were off TV for so long. Not only will it help keep guys healthy, it will help keep stories fresh"}

{"label":"NOT_SARCASM","text":"@USER You are an awesome human being . This will stay with them as will you . #faith #DoingTheRightThing","context":" The young woman was speaking thru a Mandarin interpreter . She started walking back toward the jail cells . Officers turned her around & pointed to freedom . Head down she walked out of court . Turned around to students . Riveted . I pointed out a couple of things from those 2 minutes : 1 . Notice how she had her retinas scanned before she was brought up ? State surveillance . 2 . Most charged w \/ prostitution are sex workers who want agency or human trafficking victims . Why arrest \/ prosecute at all ? 3 . 9\/10 judges would have granted dismissal . Justice is arbitrary . I know theyre 5th graders . But responses & thoughtfulness earlier earned real talk on difficult subjects . They got it . \" Jail doesn't help people that are already victims . \" \" But she  the judge  seemed so nice earlier . \" \" What happens now ? \" Hands raising right & left . But next case : Man charged w \/ assault in second degree . Prosecution consented to his release . Lessons : * Prosecutors have a lot of power . * When they decide to let someone to go home , judge will release them . Doesn't matter the charges . They could stop pretrial detention today if they wanted to . Hand raised . Girl who hadnt spoken . \" The ppl really seem to like their public defenders . \" Told them how impt it is to build trust w \/ ppl you represent & vice-versa . How everyone has so much in common w \/ each other even if we couldnt seem more different . How difficult it often is . Young girl lead out next . Robbery charge for stealing jewelry from cousin during fight . Prosecution again consents to release ( good on them ) . But requests , as always , a stay away order . Colleague raises issues that may arise at family functions . Judge allows incidental contact . Lessons : ( 1 ) Again , power of prosecutors to limit jail ( good ) . ( 2 ) Prosecutors power to not charge the highest possible charge as they did here knowing that it really is no more than a family fight ( bad ) . ( 3 ) The impact that orders of protection can have , esp on family members . Last case students saw : Charge of 1st degree robbery . Claim : Client pretended to have firearm in pocket . Stole chain & money from someone in store . Prosecution requested $ 25k bail . A woman in the audience cried out at the amount . The students all looked . Whispers : \" It's his mom . \" Colleague first castigated prosecution for bringing up prior cases he brought up should have been sealed bc of his age at the time . Note : Youthful & juvenile offender records supposed to be sealed , but still show up on RAP sheets . Then turned to facts : He was just outside & not involved in anything . Thats what put him in police radar for arrest & later lineup . Our office went down to precinct w \/ him ( already rep him on open lowlevel case thatll be dismissed ) . Requested fair lineup . Colleague had photo of it . It . Was . Not . Fair . Colleague showed photo to judge . Started to describe : \" He was only skinny , light-skinned black man . To his right is a hefty white man . \" Judge cut her off . \" This isn't a trial or suppression hearing . \" \" True , but strength of case is relevant to your bail decision . \" ( Shes right ) . Colleague proceeded : In close touch with our office . Mother in audience . Can't possibly afford anything close to $ 50k ( note : Mistake above in thread . Prosecution asked for $ 50k ) . Making all current court appearances . Case will go nowhere . \" Please release him . \" Bail set : $ 25k . Mom started crying . Walked out . Young man guided back toward the cells behind courtroom . Heard whispers : \" He's going to jail . \" \" Rikers Island . \" Looked & the students were bothered . One girl whispered a question : \" If he needed a public defender , how could he afford $ 25k ? \" Bingo . Walked out of court , past mom crying w \/ his attorney , & sat down on benches . Answered the girl : \" He can't afford $ 25k . Most of my clients can't afford $ 100 . \" Explained bail was supposed to be incentive . Law only allows bail enough to ensure return to court . They were thinking . \" Then why did she set bail higher than he could pay if she knew he couldn't afford it ? \" Explained judges are human . Humans driven by fear . Nothing bad could happen to her if he goes to jail . But if she did right , legal thing , she could lose her job if anything bad happened . Another girl : \" But if law says you cant do bail higher than they can afford , didn't she just commit a crime ? \" \" No , but she violated state law & Constitution . \" A boy : \" What happens to her then ? \" Me : \" We appeal arguing she ' abused her discretion . ' They usually get denied . \" \" Why ? \" \" Because the judges reviewing bail decisions work in the same courts & know her . They work together . How do you think she'd feel if one of our colleagues said she \" abused her discretion . \" \" Really bad . \" \" Remember : Again , all judges are human . All too often , feelings trump law . \" Students had hard time wrapping their heads around how judge could just do that & get away w \/ it . It's hard , frankly , for me to wrap my head around . Explained it's also about incentives . If we celebrate mercy , leniency , rationality more across system , we'd all be better off . I mentioned how I never could be a criminal court judge . How I'd never want to be empowered to jail someone . One of the smallest of the kids said : \" Seeing all that * made me want to be a criminal court judge . So that I could have the power to do the right thing . \" Praised him . There were a number of other questions . Then time was up . Walked outside . Took a photo in front of the courthouse . And mutual thank yous . I told them how incredibly impressed I was with them , & told them they all give me hope for the future of criminal \" justice . \" They really do ."}

Trying to keep busy best I can . <URL> UPDATE 12\/01 \/ 19 : I actually have an onion order for this week , 12 pallets ( 45 50lb bags on a pallet ) for Friday . That \u2019 s about 26 bulk boxes . That still leaves another 1,400 to go . I can \u2019 t complain . Better than nothing .

UPDATE 12\/13 \/ 19 : I am told that the price to the grower will drop further for onions . I am being offered $ . 14lb . for medium yellows . Canada getting blamed . How low can it go ? Based on inflation and basic fairness it should be at least $ . 24lb . #onions <URL> UPDATE 12\/14 \/ 19 : I was unable to sell a single onion this week .

It was also around this age when I realized I'm relatively more open & my thinking different from others around me . I guess my depression already started though back then I wasn't really aware , thought that harming myself to feel better is normal \/ OK . But this song's lyrics & video really left a mark on me . What about \" flaws \" ? What about \" differences \" ? There's so many out there , I am not alone . Even the starting lyrics ' are powerful . \" Everyday is so wonderful Then suddenly It's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed \" This . Even now , I still don't know why I'm like this .

The testimony & evidence considered in a Senate impeachment trial should be the same testimony & evidence the House relied upon when they passed the Articles of Impeachment . Our job is to vote on what the House passed , not to conduct an open ended inquiry . @USER No . You're 100 % wrong . A Trial requires : \u2022 Evidence \u2022 Witnesses Your job , Senator Rubio , is to be an * impartial * juror . @USER @USER So does an indictment , and yet the House chose to pass the Articles anyway . Both things also require a crime , which was also lacking in the whole thing . They alleged a crime in the beginning , but then never included that crime in the Articles . @USER @USER @USER Which came first : the Constitution , or the USC ? @USER @USER @USER Does it matter if neither Abuse of Power nor Obstruction of Congress are codified as criminal acts ? @USER @USER @USER Yes it does matter that they are not crimes . Obstruction of congress is part of the duties of the executive branch . And abuse of power is so common , as well as a matter of opinion ( in most cases ) @USER @USER @USER I think you misread my post . I was responding to the \" which came first \" question with my answer . It doesn't matter which came first as those things aren't crimes , so should not be the basis of an impeachment ( included with crimes , sure , but not stand alone ) . @USER @USER @USER Violation of the emoluments clauses is explicitly impeachable , which provides a practical bribery test , in the Constitution itself . By that very reasonable standard , bribery was committed . @USER @USER @USER There's a very good reason they didn't include a violation of the emoluments clause in their Articles : Trump donates all funds gained from foreign governments at his properties to the US Treasury . @USER @USER @USER Receiving them is the violation . You've got to apply being a stickler both directions . @USER @USER @USER Nope . Benjamin Franklin received a gift from some European country , France , I think it was . Congress then declared that he could keep it . Congress can't make a decision about whether a government agent can keep a gift unless the gift is known , which is after it's given . @USER @USER @USER Gifting , particularly among governments , are not hecessarily spontaneous , and a strict reading of the Constitution calls for prior consent of Congress . Congress makes decisions about things that haven't happened yet all the time . It's what they actually do for a day job . @USER @USER @USER No , that's not the way it's ever been interpreted precisely because most gifts are not known of ahead of time . But you're right about Congress making decisions on things that haven't happened yet . They decided in 2016 to impeach Trump for something that didn't happen until 2018 @USER @USER @USER GOP shouldn't beat that horse . They were after Obama from day one , impeachment ( you may recall \" that's change I can believe in \" t - shirts ) , make him a one-term President declared for the record by #moscowmitch on #Senate floor , or just by hook or crook . @USER @USER @USER But how many times did they actually try to draft Articles or open an Impeachment inquiry ? I can't find any . Some Democrats tried to draft Articles 3 or 4 times prior to this , mostly based on tweets Trump sent . @USER @USER @USER Trump didn't suddenly become an authoritarian man-child who would be king . Decades of visibility there . America allowed a person who has operated within his businesses with absolute authority to become president of a democratic republic .

{"label":"NOT_SARCASM","text":"Well then let\u2019s just get Will Ferrell as Trebek.","context":" How would you feel about at least one presidential primary debate being replaced with a history\/civics themed contest of Jeopardy between the candidates? This sort of reminds me of when we (Finland) were having a Presidential election where the two final candidates appeared on a comedy quiz show about current events (our version of \"Have I Got News for You\"). The candidate who was much more funny in the show won the election, and the other candidate's people would complain that voters seemed to have been sold on basically impromptu humour and a good performance in TV - as if that sort of thing didn't already swing elections whether they're on a comedy show or not. The suggestion in this thread is at least about something more important than just the week's news, so why not do it? There would be a huge incentive to intentionally throw for comedic value. Start saying obviously wrong joke answers, you appear likeable and at the same time invalidate the score, so if you lose it's whatever. I guess with European-style quiz panel shows, that's not really even considered throwing it. The jokes are the point of the show, and if someone seriously plays to win they are doing it as a sort of subversive meta-joke. Even if the host is ostensibly keeping score, no one cares about points or prizes. People pretty much always play to win Jeopardy. So if that's the setup, it'd be unexpected to turn it into a comedy show. Not really it'd just turn into a SNL Celebrity Jeopardy skit."}

{"label":"NOT_SARCASM","text":"@USER Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year \u2019 s Eve !","context":" 1 . I \u2019 ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I \u2019 ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is \u201c razor thin \u201d . 2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that \u2019 s just \u201c business as usual \u201d for Suleimani ) 3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader \u2019 s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything . 4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran \u2019 s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy . 5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap . 6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the \u201c far out option \u201d 7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL> 8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official . 9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : <URL> 10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they \u2019 re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far . 11 . But among the \u201c menu options \u201d that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . <URL> 12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias 13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to @USER for insight . He \u2019 s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America \u2019 s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq : 14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US \u2019 posture in Iraq 15 . \u201c It \u2019 s all been downhill , \u201d @USER told me , in terms of America \u2019 s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces 16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked . 17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one \u2019 s trying to downplay Suleimani \u2019 s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga ."}
